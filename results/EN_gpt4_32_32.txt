The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.

At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful langua\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nge instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told \nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\nme after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\n public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This C\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\nFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquir\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\ne.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.

Even if it's the right thing   \nfor\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\n your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \n\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix som\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\ne other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\n a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the fo\nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\nunders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are se\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\nlling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\n\nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it w\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\nas a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\n, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguag\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\nes is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software va\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\nries in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds \nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\nof elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Des\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\nign for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.

That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a l\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\nanguage that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approac\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nh: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the sa\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\nme appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\n  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the languag\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\ne that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\n I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly \nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\nimportant component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess \nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\nwhat library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nrelease\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.

C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it is\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\nn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two w\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\nere very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.

How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost any\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\nthing\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\n wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency o\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\nf research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoin\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\nt.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do Y\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nou Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a \nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\nrule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile h\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\naving actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\ns\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\noftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture \nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\ncapitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that spe\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\ned only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Applica\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\ntion to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\n.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have imp\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\nroved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting \nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\na startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, whic\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nh is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  W\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\nhich\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\n first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying \nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\nto see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragil\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\ne plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let fo\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\nunders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.

Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorribl\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\ne one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the \nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\nsense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\n released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines i\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\nn the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing \nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\nthe application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because p\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\neople are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthe\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nm what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on L\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\nisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, se\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\nrious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with pr\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\nefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\n\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\nc\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\nycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good ide\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\na.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commer\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\nce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predic\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\nted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nt\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\no the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people \nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nlike him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\n early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year old\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\ns get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their gr\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\nowth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule agains\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\nt doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first m\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\nillion is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\n for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is beca\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nuse people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing system\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\ns of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\n for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you de\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\nsign a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-sour\nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\nce software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the ma\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\nnual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\n it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.

The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\n perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.

In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as mu\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\nch of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1.

With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\n  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers ar\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\ne solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in \nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\n1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\n want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\n appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language \nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nlevel.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing \nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\noff in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and form\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\ns.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\n what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a comm\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\nittee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages \nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\nare.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agre\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\ne\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the ter\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\n and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like Base\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\nCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollar\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\ns a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\n have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\n buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\n, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want fo\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\nunders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\n a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders parti\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\nally\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least mater\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nial.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\n like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentag\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\ne of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\n language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the langu\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\nage that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programmin\nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\ng languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new appli\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\ncations that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuat\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\nion-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs mu\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\nst not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few c\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\nritical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in th\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\ne first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\n throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-b\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\nased software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  Bu\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\nt I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\n everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data struc\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\nture,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people de\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nsign\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Scree\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\nns\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same t\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\nime the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAlta\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\nVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much \nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\nFrederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\n\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\n more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased bel\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  Y\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\nou can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture c\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\napitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis \nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\nboth the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Go\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nogle's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enro\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\nns, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, al\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\nl the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If fo\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\nunders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them s\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\nomething still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way.\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\n Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of th\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\ne worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attit\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof libr\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\nary functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectua\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\nl\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an u\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\nnfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations. \nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\n In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had s\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\no long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don'\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\nt need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steel\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\ne also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\n with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think t\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\nhere will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a go\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\nod idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think o\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\nbject-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlyin\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\ng stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size \nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\nwindow people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with \nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\na drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was \nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nbetter if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, \nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\nin Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\n called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\n it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surpr\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\nise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\n Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was \nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\n13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something \nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\ngood you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\n to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising littl\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\ne 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npe\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other proble\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\nm.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\n a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us foun\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\nders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair de\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\nsigners have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for ot\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\nher people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as mu\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nch\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand re\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find t\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\nhe library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big re\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\nleases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\n1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I \nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\ndon't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your langua\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\nge to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\n out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For ex\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\nample, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applicati\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\nons will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in b\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\nig companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\n it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious indi\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\nvidual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet),\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\n we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\n\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though i\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\nt wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\n even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\n they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\n\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The la\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\nnguage we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\n instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college w\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\nas that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the \nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\nlanguage of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you l\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.An\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\nd of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third proble\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\nm: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquir\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\ners don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvio\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nus one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an al\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\nmost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put t\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\no work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from bein\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\ng \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\n. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\n they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and speci\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nal cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The \nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nSymbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-base\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\nd software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages. \nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\n \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language \nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\nimplementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould n\nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\n that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it \nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\nbecause byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\n kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\n he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so public\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\nity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online \nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\ntransactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the un\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\nique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to w\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\nrite down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its eff\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\nect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguin\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\ngly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\n processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sha\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\nring, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\n the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Li\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\nsp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I wa\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\ns about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wre\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\nckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floati\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\nng around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enoug\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median la\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\nnguage has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces fri\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\nghtening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup Sc\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\nhool.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the ec\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nonomy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\n 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly wi\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\nth Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some k\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\ninds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to th\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\nink this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\n the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take \nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nto write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be des\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nigned to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away th\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\nis whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together wi\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\nth some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be tha\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\nt they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nschedul\nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\ning within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\n Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and m\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\nethods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render di\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\nsplay text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreport\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\ners liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolo\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\ncating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crus\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\nade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a comp\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\niled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\n\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer,\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\n card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by \nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\nHeathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in t\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nhe air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love work\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\ning on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was c\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\nlear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was t\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\nhat it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nb\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\ne truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\n asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a \nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\nletter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limit\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same wo\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\nrk might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go \nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\ntoo far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\n lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\n instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of \nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\nthe company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract desig\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\nn problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks do\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\nwn to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\n of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to desi\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\ngn a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes. \nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\n You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical peop\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nle\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were bei\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\nng used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out th\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\nat\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoft\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\nware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so \nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\nmuch more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWh\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\nen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about \nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\nthe same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\n out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\n\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\no\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\nf which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something aga\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\nin is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\n school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\n a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\n made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slo\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\npes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often ha\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nppens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyo\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\nne who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.Tha\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\nt fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\n\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't k\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\nnow how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at \nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\nnight. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould b\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\ne distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsourc\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\ne their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof eno\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\nugh that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\n to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and \nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nthey worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, wh\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\nich in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs ea\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\nsier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof \nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\na governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architec\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\nture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\n exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftwa\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nre there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it wri\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nting a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be \nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\nrelated\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have \nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\nto pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\n programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this \nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\nisn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserte\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\nd him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\n, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it,\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\n I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\no\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\nf reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nTha\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\nnks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, becaus\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\ne they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspac\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\ne of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\n\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, s\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\nimply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dand\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\nelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould \nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\ntake classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I ima\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\ngined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet agai\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\nn about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na gene\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\nric person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I w\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\norked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for \nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\neverything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing late\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\nr became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his developm\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\nent\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping t\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\nhem up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was prac\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\ntically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\n the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguo\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\nus.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of oth\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\ner people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with j\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\nust a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\n your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile havin\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\ng actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\n knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting softw\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nare in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fas\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\nt enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-O\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\nriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else pe\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\nople do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the\nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\n 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.

Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore \nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\nprecisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\n\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differ\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\nently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the b\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\nasement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive i\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\nn those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\n be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Har\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\nvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory \nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\n indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I \nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\nknew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world the\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\nre that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked u\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\np the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditiona\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\nl m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort \nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\nof\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\n back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\nBetter organized, c\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\nertainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\nPainting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\nof dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\nbest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\ndefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A\nrent-controlled apartment in a building her mother own\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\ned in New\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\nUpper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\nNow I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\ndays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers\nof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager.

I'd seen what graphical\nuser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.\nI was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\nwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one progra\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\nmmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they \nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\nwait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth. \nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\n I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of s\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nhares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Design\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\ning algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good pr\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\nogramming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\n physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for t\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\nhe new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody under\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\nstands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made th\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nis point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel,\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\n and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\n your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary \nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\nto take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web de\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\nsigners.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  I\nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\nn return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and \nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\nsolve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\n sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\n reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Th\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\nough I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; thi\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\ns was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data struct\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\nures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that wo\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\nuld\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got ki\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\ncked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her att\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\nic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\n out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\n of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge am\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\nounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro \nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\nstuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\nBetter organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\nPainting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\nof dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\nbest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\ndefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor.\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\n A\nrent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\nUpper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\nNow I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\ndays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers\nof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't\nthat much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll \nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\nbe able to work\non whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called\nthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited\nhim in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It\nseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical\nuser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.\nI was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\nwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art\ngalleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy\nones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate\nweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and\nset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up\ngalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.\nIt was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites\nfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that\nexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd\nbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called\nan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy\nof ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write\nsoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to be\nnormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.\nThat was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to\nwrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix\nworld. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping c\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\nart, and I wrote a new\nsite generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate\nwas away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his\nroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a\nmattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress\nI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran\nthe software on the server, and let users control it by clicking\non links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve\nthem from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at\nthe time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,\nwe decided to try making a version of our store builder that you\ncould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August\n12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you\ncould build a whole store through the browser, without any client\nsoftware or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a\nwhole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't\nneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there\nhad been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to\nbe at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.\nNow you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our\nsoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding\nfrom Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the\ninitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%\nof the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y\nCombinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because\nwe'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth,\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\n because the thousand\ndollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by\nwhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside\nthe proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?\nNo, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,\nI needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious\nabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to\nbuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating\npages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be\ngenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,\nthe links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the\nserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online\nstore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking\nlegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts\nand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his\nbedroom look more legit than a b\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's pro\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\nbably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that'\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\ns what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the st\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\nartup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\n\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages ha\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\nve to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  \nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\nI could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what yo\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\nu want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I \nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\nwould really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they wou\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\nld\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've mad\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\ne up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That woul\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nd be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more genera\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\nl, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culm\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\nination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our \nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\noffices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures\nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\n which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first \nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\ntime.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I w\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\nas puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would b\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\ne mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique \nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\nin 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\n Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it \nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\nhad to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages.\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\n There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution \nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\nin\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color ch\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\nanges suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect \nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\nof Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone els\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\ne will\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\nBetter organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\nPainting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\nof dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\nbest art school in the country, to learn \nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\nto draw even better. They\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\ndefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A\nrent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\nUpper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\nNow I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\ndays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers\nof former\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\n students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't\nthat much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work\non whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called\nthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited\nhim in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It\nseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical\nuser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.\nI was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\nwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art\ngalleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy\nones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate\nweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and\nset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up\ngalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.\nIt was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites\nfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that\nexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd\nbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called\nan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy\nof ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write\nsoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to be\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\n\nnormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.\nThat was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to\nwrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix\nworld. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new\nsite generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate\nwas away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his\nroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a\nmattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress\nI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran\nthe software on the server, and let users control it by clicking\non links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve\nthem from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at\nthe time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,\nwe decided to try making a version of our store builder that you\ncould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August\n12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you\ncould build a whole store through the browser, without any client\nsoftware or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a\nwhole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't\nneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there\nhad been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to\nbe at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.\nNow you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our\nsoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding\nfrom Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the\ninitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%\nof the company. \nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\nTen years later this deal became the model for Y\nCombinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because\nwe'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand\ndollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by\nwhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside\nthe proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?\nNo, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,\nI needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious\nabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to\nbuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating\npages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be\ngenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,\nthe links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the\nserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online\nstore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking\nlegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts\nand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his\nbedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because\nit's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but\nin 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a\nmonth,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in\nretrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years\nlater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,\nand I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.\nHe recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because\nat that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything\nin his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with\nhim. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a\nfrighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two\nmos\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\nt independent-minded people \nI know, and in completely different\nways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a\ncolonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's\nit would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just\nas well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were\nlate, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of\ntalk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually\nwanted online stores.\n[8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which\npeople used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,\nwhich Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and\nstatistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one\nof the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight\nand didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's\nand Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do\nwas work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the\neasiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of\nit stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were\ninstead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second\nhalf of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not\nthe Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It\nwas lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make\nViaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a\nmonth for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low\nprice was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of\ncompetitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we\nset the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.\n$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,\nwe did what's now called \"doing things that \ndon't scale,\" although\nat the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're\ndriven to the m\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\nost desperate measures to get users.\" The most common\nof which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly\nhumiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that\npeople could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get\nusers.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For\nexample, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt\n(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better\nto have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.\nThe reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to\nrescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were\nso beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.\nBuilding stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it\nfelt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled\nby \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in\ncharge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,\nin much the same wa\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to giv\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\ne startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit ab\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\nout it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some \nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\nstock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivin\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\ngston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\n the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual s\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\nhould\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty yea\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\nrs will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not m\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\nanagers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway progra\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\nm is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code,\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\n which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming i\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\ns because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seem\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\ned surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\n's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at \nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\nmy bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks \nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\nmultiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\n it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I d\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\niscovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could \nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\ntake whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\n wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\n different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to colleg\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\ne again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as \nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\npossible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\n when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, \nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\nmy budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\nBetter organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At leas\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\nt not the\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\nPainting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\nof dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\nbest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\ndefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A\nrent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\nUpper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\nNow I was a New York artist  in the strict\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nly technical sense of\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\ndays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers\nof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't\nthat much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work\non whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called\nthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited\nhim in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It\nseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical\nuser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.\nI was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\nwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art\ngalleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy\nones. That's not how they\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\n sell. I wrote some software to generate\nweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and\nset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up\ngalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.\nIt was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites\nfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that\nexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd\nbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called\nan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy\nof ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write\nsoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to be\nnormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.\nThat was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to\nwrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix\nworld. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new\nsite generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate\nwas away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his\nroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a\nmattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress\nI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran\nthe software on the server, and let users control it by clicking\non links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve\nthem from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at\nthe time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,\nwe decided to try making a version of our store builder that you\ncould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August\n12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you\ncould build a whole store through the browser, without any client\nsoftware or typing anything into the command\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\n line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a\nwhole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't\nneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there\nhad been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to\nbe at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.\nNow you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our\nsoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding\nfrom Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the\ninitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%\nof the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y\nCombinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because\nwe'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand\ndollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by\nwhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside\nthe proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?\nNo, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,\nI needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious\nabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to\nbuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating\npages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be\ngenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,\nthe links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the\nserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online\nstore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking\nlegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts\nand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his\nbedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because\nit's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but\nin 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a\nmonth,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in\nretrospect, beca\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\nuse he would still be working on it almost 3 years\nlater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,\nand I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.\nHe recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because\nat that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything\nin his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with\nhim. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a\nfrighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two\nmost independent-minded people \nI know, and in completely different\nways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a\ncolonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's\nit would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just\nas well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were\nlate, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of\ntalk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually\nwanted online stores.\n[8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which\npeople used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,\nwhich Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and\nstatistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one\nof the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight\nand didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's\nand Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do\nwas work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the\neasiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of\nit stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were\ninstead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second\nhalf of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not\nthe Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It\nwas lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make\nViaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a\nmonth for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low\nprice was a big attraction, \nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\nand a constant thorn in the sides of\ncompetitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we\nset the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.\n$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,\nwe did what's now called \"doing things that \ndon't scale,\" although\nat the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're\ndriven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common\nof which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly\nhumiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that\npeople could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get\nusers.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For\nexample, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt\n(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better\nto have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.\nThe reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to\nrescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were\nso beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.\nBuilding stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it\nfelt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled\nby \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in\ncharge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,\nin much the same way I was converted to \nfatherhood once I had kids.\nWhatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have\nso many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in\nthe meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn't get at the time is that \ngrowth rate is the\nultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about\n70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I\nmistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number\nof users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that\nthat's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough,\nyou might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate\ntakes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I \nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\nwas\nadvising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed\nout, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't\nhire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then\nyou'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted\nme to, and partly because that's what startups did during the\nInternet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would\nhave seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about\nwhen Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we\nwere at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.\nAnd since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the\nresult was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb\nstock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable\nand growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had\nno idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of\nthe near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor\nhad I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we\nstarted. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to\nriches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow\n1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were\nby far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must\nhave been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at\nthe time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running\nViaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue\nmy usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue\ncombined with Yahoo's prematurely aged\nculture and grim cube farm\nin Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it\nfelt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the\ntime I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth\nanything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next\nyear. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the\nsummer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted any\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\nthing\nthat I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been\nentirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had\ndone this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now\nI was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation\nwith me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures\nI wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an\ninterest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.\nMy options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I\nwas leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to\ngo and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people\nwith me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was\nground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving\nthen to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,\nand yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.\nThere was no time to\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me a\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\nfter a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big techno\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\nlogy\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\n stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor fr\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers \nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\nwill like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have t\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\no remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based \nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\nsoftware\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in pra\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\nctice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use \nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\nof an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will \nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nbe a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't t\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nrue.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\n\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online st\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\nore, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would b\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\ne to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair \nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\ndown there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study phi\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\nlosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelli\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\ngence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\nComputer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable \nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\nto make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamen\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\ntal subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\n a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and ga\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\nve me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplann\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\ned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\nBetter organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\nPainting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\nof dollars for it. That'\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\ns not always why artists have a signature\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\nbest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\ndefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A\nrent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\nUpper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\nNow I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\ndays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students.\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\n Large numbers\nof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't\nthat much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work\non whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called\nthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited\nhim in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It\nseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical\nuser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.\nI was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\nwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art\ngalleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy\nones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate\nweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and\nset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up\ngalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.\nIt was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites\nfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that\nexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd\nbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called\nan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy\nof ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write\nsoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to be\nnormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.\nThat was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to\nwrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix\nworld. But we decided we'd a\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nt least try writing a prototype store\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new\nsite generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate\nwas away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his\nroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a\nmattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress\nI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran\nthe software on the server, and let users control it by clicking\non links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve\nthem from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at\nthe time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,\nwe decided to try making a version of our store builder that you\ncould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August\n12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you\ncould build a whole store through the browser, without any client\nsoftware or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a\nwhole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't\nneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there\nhad been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to\nbe at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.\nNow you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our\nsoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding\nfrom Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the\ninitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%\nof the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y\nCombinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because\nwe'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand\ndollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by\nwhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside\nthe proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?\nNo, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,\nI ne\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\neded that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious\nabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to\nbuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating\npages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be\ngenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,\nthe links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the\nserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online\nstore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking\nlegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts\nand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his\nbedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because\nit's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but\nin 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a\nmonth,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in\nretrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years\nlater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,\nand I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.\nHe recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because\nat that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything\nin his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with\nhim. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a\nfrighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two\nmost independent-minded people \nI know, and in completely different\nways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a\ncolonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's\nit would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just\nas well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were\nlate, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of\ntalk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually\nwanted online stores.\n[8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which\npeople used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,\nwhich Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track \nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\nof orders and\nstatistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one\nof the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight\nand didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's\nand Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do\nwas work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the\neasiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of\nit stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were\ninstead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second\nhalf of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not\nthe Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It\nwas lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make\nViaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a\nmonth for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low\nprice was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of\ncompetitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we\nset the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.\n$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,\nwe did what's now called \"doing things that \ndon't scale,\" although\nat the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're\ndriven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common\nof which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly\nhumiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that\npeople could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get\nusers.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For\nexample, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt\n(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better\nto have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.\nThe reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to\nrescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were\nso beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.\nBuilding stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it\nfelt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled\nby \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in\ncharge of it, but once we started t\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\no get users, I was converted,\nin much the same way I was converted to \nfatherhood once I had kids.\nWhatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have\nso many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in\nthe meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn't get at the time is that \ngrowth rate is the\nultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about\n70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I\nmistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number\nof users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that\nthat's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough,\nyou might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate\ntakes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was\nadvising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed\nout, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't\nhire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then\nyou'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted\nme to, and partly because that's what startups did during the\nInternet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would\nhave seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about\nwhen Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we\nwere at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.\nAnd since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the\nresult was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb\nstock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable\nand growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had\nno idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of\nthe near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor\nhad I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we\nstarted. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to\nriches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow\n1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were\nby far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must\nhave been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at\nthe time, but I was \nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\nworn out from the effort and stress of running\nViaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue\nmy usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue\ncombined with Yahoo's prematurely aged\nculture and grim cube farm\nin Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it\nfelt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the\ntime I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth\nanything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next\nyear. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the\nsummer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything\nthat I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been\nentirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had\ndone this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now\nI was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation\nwith me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures\nI wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an\ninterest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.\nMy options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I\nwas leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to\ngo and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people\nwith me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was\nground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving\nthen to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,\nand yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.\nThere was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich.\nNow when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their\ncompanies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's\nwhat I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing\nfor a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or\nambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people\nin California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in\nthe Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from\nanywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation\nI went \nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\nback to New York, where unless you understand about rent\ncontrol you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed\nup like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and\nthere were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't\nknow any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was\nrich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns,\nexcept now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was\ntired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless\nit was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked\npast charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It\nwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented\nwith a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the\nold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and\nthen use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted\nfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually\nchoose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and\nvarious real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by\noccasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there\nwasn't one. Huh.Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear\nfrom our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why\nnot build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit\ncode on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting\napplications for them?\n[9]\nYou could run all sorts of services\non the servers that these applications could use just by making an\nAPI call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images,\ntaking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything\nelse. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly\nwant to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would\nhave to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and\nstart it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but\nthere I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and\nthough he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into\nworking on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.\nSo while he agreed t\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\nhat it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly\nrefused to work on it.Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had\nworked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and\nwe got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty\ncompanies and several open source projects worth of software. The\nlanguage for defining applications would of course be a dialect of\nLisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt\nLisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan\ndid.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an\n\"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long\nbefore it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current\nfor long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going\nto be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network\ninfrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two\nservices (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the\nsum\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave t\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\no give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOr\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\ndinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"ratio\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\nnal\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata t\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nhrough a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\n then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\n)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\n  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application shou\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\nld not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least tha\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\nt we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give \nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nyou some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went \nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nfrom impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it wi\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\nth 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgot\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\nten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I d\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\nidn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 \nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\nwas\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next coup\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\nle years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\n about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious \nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\ngeniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\n\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedr\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\noom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\n was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat i\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\nt's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\nBetter organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\nPainting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\nof dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\nbest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\ndefinitely closer to their tribe t\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\nhan the tribe of signature style\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A\nrent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\nUpper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\nNow I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\ndays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers\nof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't\nthat much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work\non whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called\nthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited\nhim in Cambridge, where he was no\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\nw in grad school at Harvard. It\nseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical\nuser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.\nI was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\nwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art\ngalleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy\nones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate\nweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and\nset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up\ngalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.\nIt was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites\nfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that\nexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd\nbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called\nan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy\nof ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write\nsoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to be\nnormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.\nThat was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to\nwrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix\nworld. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new\nsite generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate\nwas away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his\nroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a\nmattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress\nI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran\nthe software on the server, and let users control it by clicking\non links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve\nthem from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web a\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\npp, is common now, but at\nthe time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,\nwe decided to try making a version of our store builder that you\ncould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August\n12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you\ncould build a whole store through the browser, without any client\nsoftware or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a\nwhole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't\nneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there\nhad been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to\nbe at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.\nNow you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our\nsoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding\nfrom Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the\ninitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%\nof the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y\nCombinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because\nwe'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand\ndollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by\nwhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside\nthe proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?\nNo, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,\nI needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious\nabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to\nbuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating\npages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be\ngenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,\nthe links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the\nserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online\nstore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking\nlegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts\nand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his\nbedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because\nit's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but\nin 1996 it was the last word in s\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nlick.)In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a\nmonth,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in\nretrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years\nlater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,\nand I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.\nHe recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because\nat that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything\nin his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with\nhim. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a\nfrighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two\nmost independent-minded people \nI know, and in completely different\nways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a\ncolonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's\nit would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just\nas well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were\nlate, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of\ntalk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually\nwanted online stores.\n[8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which\npeople used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,\nwhich Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and\nstatistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one\nof the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight\nand didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's\nand Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do\nwas work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the\neasiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of\nit stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were\ninstead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second\nhalf of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not\nthe Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It\nwas lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make\nViaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a\nmonth for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low\nprice was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of\ncompetitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\n\nset the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.\n$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,\nwe did what's now called \"doing things that \ndon't scale,\" although\nat the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're\ndriven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common\nof which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly\nhumiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that\npeople could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get\nusers.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For\nexample, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt\n(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better\nto have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.\nThe reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to\nrescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were\nso beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.\nBuilding stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it\nfelt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled\nby \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in\ncharge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,\nin much the same way I was converted to \nfatherhood once I had kids.\nWhatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have\nso many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in\nthe meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn't get at the time is that \ngrowth rate is the\nultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about\n70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I\nmistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number\nof users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that\nthat's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough,\nyou might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate\ntakes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was\nadvising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed\nout, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't\nhire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then\nyou'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted\nme to, and partly because that's what startups\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\n did during the\nInternet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would\nhave seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about\nwhen Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we\nwere at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.\nAnd since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the\nresult was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb\nstock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable\nand growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had\nno idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of\nthe near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor\nhad I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we\nstarted. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to\nriches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow\n1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were\nby far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must\nhave been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at\nthe time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running\nViaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue\nmy usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue\ncombined with Yahoo's prematurely aged\nculture and grim cube farm\nin Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it\nfelt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the\ntime I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth\nanything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next\nyear. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the\nsummer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything\nthat I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been\nentirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had\ndone this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now\nI was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation\nwith me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures\nI wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an\ninterest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.\nMy options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I\nwas leaving that kind of mone\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\ny on the table, it could only be to\ngo and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people\nwith me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was\nground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving\nthen to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,\nand yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.\nThere was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich.\nNow when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their\ncompanies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's\nwhat I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing\nfor a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or\nambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people\nin California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in\nthe Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from\nanywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation\nI went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent\ncontrol you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed\nup like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and\nthere were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't\nknow any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was\nrich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns,\nexcept now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was\ntired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless\nit was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked\npast charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It\nwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented\nwith a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the\nold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and\nthen use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted\nfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually\nchoose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and\nvarious real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by\noccasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there\nwasn't one. Huh.Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear\nfrom our experience with Viaweb that web apps were \nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\nthe future. Why\nnot build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit\ncode on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting\napplications for them?\n[9]\nYou could run all sorts of services\non the servers that these applications could use just by making an\nAPI call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images,\ntaking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything\nelse. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly\nwant to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would\nhave to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and\nstart it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but\nthere I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and\nthough he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into\nworking on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.\nSo while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly\nrefused to work on it.Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had\nworked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and\nwe got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty\ncompanies and several open source projects worth of software. The\nlanguage for defining applications would of course be a dialect of\nLisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt\nLisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan\ndid.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an\n\"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long\nbefore it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current\nfor long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going\nto be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network\ninfrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two\nservices (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the\nsummer I realized I really didn't want to run a company  especially\nnot a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I'd\nonly started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't\nneed money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be\nrealized as a company, then screw the vision. I'd build a subset\nthat could be done as an open source project.Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not\nwasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often\n\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\nencounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and\nit was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and\neven trying to write some of it.The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp,\nwhose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp\nhackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the\ndistinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and\npartly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of\nLisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So\nat the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new\ndialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a\ntalk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp\nat Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,\non paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but\nhad never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.\nWhat on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone\nhad posted it on Slashdot.\n[10]Wow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put\nit on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but\nit was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel\nto readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only\nway to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published\nas a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish\nanything.This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people\nhad realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building\nthe infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer\nas well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it\ntook me several years to understand the implications. It meant there\nwould be a whole new generation of \nessays.\n[11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been\nvanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers\nwho went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed\nto publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.\nThere were so many essays that had never been written, because there\nhad been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going\nto write them.\n[12]I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there\nwas a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\n\nwhen I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that\nwhatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a \nmarginal medium at first.\nSocially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their\nGeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions\npublished in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to\nfind that encouraging instead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how\nwell it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't\nprestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form\nof painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started\nthem. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what\nI'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish\non my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in\nsomething like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when\nyou fi\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\n\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as thi\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\nngs look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the fo\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\nunders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when \nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nI say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart pe\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\nople really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\n, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\nLanguage designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win \nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\nin languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It wo\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\nuld certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acqui\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nsition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\n real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I rememb\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\ner so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\n it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, a\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\ns\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant le\nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\narning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids t\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\nhat could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even nee\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\nd to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of p\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\neople of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it lo\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\nok\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\n to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\nbe, and will squash you against t\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\nhe ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\nBetter organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\nPainting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\nof dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\nbest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\ndefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\n me a big favor. A\nrent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\nUpper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\nNow I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\ndays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers\nof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't\nthat much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work\non whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called\nthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited\nhim in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It\nseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical\nuser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.\nI was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\nwe should start a company to put art galleri\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\nes online. I can't\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art\ngalleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy\nones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate\nweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and\nset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up\ngalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.\nIt was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites\nfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that\nexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd\nbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called\nan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy\nof ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write\nsoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to be\nnormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.\nThat was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to\nwrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix\nworld. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new\nsite generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate\nwas away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his\nroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a\nmattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress\nI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran\nthe software on the server, and let users control it by clicking\non links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve\nthem from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at\nthe time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,\nwe decided to try making a version of our store builder that you\ncould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August\n12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you\ncould build a whole store through the browser, without any client\nsoftware or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a\nwhole new generation of software working this w\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\nay. You wouldn't\nneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there\nhad been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to\nbe at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.\nNow you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our\nsoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding\nfrom Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the\ninitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%\nof the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y\nCombinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because\nwe'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand\ndollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by\nwhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside\nthe proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?\nNo, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,\nI needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious\nabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to\nbuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating\npages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be\ngenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,\nthe links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the\nserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online\nstore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking\nlegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts\nand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his\nbedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because\nit's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but\nin 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a\nmonth,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in\nretrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years\nlater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,\nand I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.\nHe recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because\nat that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything\nin his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with\nhim. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a\nfrighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun work\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\ning with Robert and Trevor. They're the two\nmost independent-minded people \nI know, and in completely different\nways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a\ncolonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's\nit would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just\nas well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were\nlate, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of\ntalk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually\nwanted online stores.\n[8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which\npeople used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,\nwhich Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and\nstatistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one\nof the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight\nand didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's\nand Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do\nwas work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the\neasiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of\nit stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were\ninstead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second\nhalf of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not\nthe Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It\nwas lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make\nViaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a\nmonth for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low\nprice was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of\ncompetitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we\nset the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.\n$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,\nwe did what's now called \"doing things that \ndon't scale,\" although\nat the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're\ndriven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common\nof which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly\nhumiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that\npeople could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get\nusers.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For\nexample, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt\n(and all images were small then by present standards), it was bet\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nter\nto have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.\nThe reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to\nrescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were\nso beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.\nBuilding stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it\nfelt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled\nby \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in\ncharge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,\nin much the same way I was converted to \nfatherhood once I had kids.\nWhatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have\nso many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in\nthe meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn't get at the time is that \ngrowth rate is the\nultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about\n70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I\nmistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number\nof users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that\nthat's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough,\nyou might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate\ntakes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was\nadvising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed\nout, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't\nhire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then\nyou'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted\nme to, and partly because that's what startups did during the\nInternet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would\nhave seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about\nwhen Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we\nwere at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.\nAnd since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the\nresult was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb\nstock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable\nand growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had\nno idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of\nthe near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor\nhad I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we\nstarted. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to\nriches. Since we were going to California, I bought a c\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\nar, a yellow\n1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were\nby far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must\nhave been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at\nthe time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running\nViaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue\nmy usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue\ncombined with Yahoo's prematurely aged\nculture and grim cube farm\nin Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it\nfelt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the\ntime I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth\nanything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next\nyear. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the\nsummer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything\nthat I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been\nentirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had\ndone this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now\nI was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation\nwith me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures\nI wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an\ninterest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.\nMy options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I\nwas leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to\ngo and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people\nwith me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was\nground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving\nthen to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,\nand yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.\nThere was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich.\nNow when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their\ncompanies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's\nwhat I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing\nfor a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or\nambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people\nin California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in\nthe Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from\nanywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\n in desperation\nI went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent\ncontrol you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed\nup like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and\nthere were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't\nknow any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was\nrich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns,\nexcept now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was\ntired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless\nit was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked\npast charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It\nwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented\nwith a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the\nold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and\nthen use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted\nfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually\nchoose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and\nvarious real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by\noccasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there\nwasn't one. Huh.Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear\nfrom our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why\nnot build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit\ncode on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting\napplications for them?\n[9]\nYou could run all sorts of services\non the servers that these applications could use just by making an\nAPI call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images,\ntaking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything\nelse. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly\nwant to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would\nhave to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and\nstart it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but\nthere I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and\nthough he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into\nworking on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.\nSo while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly\nrefused to work on it.Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had\nworked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and\nwe got to work trying to\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\n build what it's now clear is about twenty\ncompanies and several open source projects worth of software. The\nlanguage for defining applications would of course be a dialect of\nLisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt\nLisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan\ndid.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an\n\"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long\nbefore it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current\nfor long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going\nto be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network\ninfrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two\nservices (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the\nsummer I realized I really didn't want to run a company  especially\nnot a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I'd\nonly started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't\nneed money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be\nrealized as a company, then screw the vision. I'd build a subset\nthat could be done as an open source project.Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not\nwasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often\nencounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and\nit was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and\neven trying to write some of it.The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp,\nwhose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp\nhackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the\ndistinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and\npartly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of\nLisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So\nat the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new\ndialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a\ntalk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp\nat Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,\non paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but\nhad never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.\nWhat on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone\nhad posted it on Slashdot.\n[10]Wow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put\nit on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but\nit was surprising then. I\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\nn the print era there was a narrow channel\nto readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only\nway to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published\nas a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish\nanything.This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people\nhad realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building\nthe infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer\nas well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it\ntook me several years to understand the implications. It meant there\nwould be a whole new generation of \nessays.\n[11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been\nvanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers\nwho went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed\nto publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.\nThere were so many essays that had never been written, because there\nhad been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going\nto write them.\n[12]I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there\nwas a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was\nwhen I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that\nwhatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a \nmarginal medium at first.\nSocially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their\nGeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions\npublished in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to\nfind that encouraging instead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how\nwell it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't\nprestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form\nof painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started\nthem. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what\nI'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish\non my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in\nsomething like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when\nyou find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current\nlack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to\nbe discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.\nImpure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is\ngoing to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.\nSo while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't \nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\nguarantee\nyou're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the\nmost common type of wrong one.Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds\nof different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a\nbook, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I\nalso worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to\nhave dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which\ntaught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in\nCambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn\nstudio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\ndiners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one\nparty. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be\npeople they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\ncalled Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.\nThis bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,\nas she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised\nhow different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So\nshe decided to compile a book of \ninterviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her\nstaff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed\nfor a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make\nup their minds, and during this time I started telling her about\nall the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They\nshould make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a\nhandful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical\nfounders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as\nCEO, and so on.One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks.\nThe prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people\nand tell them something that won't waste their time is a great\nspur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the\nundergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would\ntell them how to start a startup.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxle\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\ny is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was cr\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\neated to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated \nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\nby the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages de\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nsigned for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit \nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\nWhat Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might tur\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\nn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it s\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\neems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\n\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that \nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\nmight naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to \nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nmillionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in f\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at \nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\nleast the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early ver\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\nsion of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was th\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\nat I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which\nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\n I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. W\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\nhile\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.M\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\neanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chattin\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\ng or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia w\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\nasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be \nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\nless prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\nBetter organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\nPainting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\nof dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\nbest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\ndefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A\nrent-controlle\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\nd apartment in a building her mother owned in New\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\nUpper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\nNow I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\ndays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers\nof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't\nthat much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work\non whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called\nthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited\nhim in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It\nseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical\nuser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.\nI was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\nwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art\ngallerie\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\ns didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy\nones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate\nweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and\nset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up\ngalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.\nIt was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites\nfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that\nexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd\nbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called\nan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy\nof ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write\nsoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to be\nnormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.\nThat was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to\nwrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix\nworld. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new\nsite generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate\nwas away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his\nroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a\nmattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress\nI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran\nthe software on the server, and let users control it by clicking\non links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve\nthem from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at\nthe time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,\nwe decided to try making a version of our store builder that you\ncould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August\n12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you\ncould build a whole store through the browser, without any client\nsoftware or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a\nwhole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't\nneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there\nhad been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to\nbe at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.\nNow you could just update the software right on the server.We started \nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\na new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our\nsoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding\nfrom Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the\ninitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%\nof the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y\nCombinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because\nwe'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand\ndollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by\nwhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside\nthe proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?\nNo, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,\nI needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious\nabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to\nbuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating\npages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be\ngenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,\nthe links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the\nserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online\nstore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking\nlegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts\nand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his\nbedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because\nit's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but\nin 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a\nmonth,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in\nretrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years\nlater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,\nand I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.\nHe recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because\nat that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything\nin his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with\nhim. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a\nfrighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two\nmost independent-minded people \nI know, and in completely different\nways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a\ncolonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's\nit would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just\nas well we waited a few months, because al\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\nthough we worried we were\nlate, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of\ntalk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually\nwanted online stores.\n[8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which\npeople used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,\nwhich Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and\nstatistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one\nof the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight\nand didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's\nand Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do\nwas work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the\neasiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of\nit stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were\ninstead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second\nhalf of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not\nthe Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It\nwas lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make\nViaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a\nmonth for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low\nprice was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of\ncompetitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we\nset the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.\n$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,\nwe did what's now called \"doing things that \ndon't scale,\" although\nat the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're\ndriven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common\nof which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly\nhumiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that\npeople could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get\nusers.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For\nexample, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt\n(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better\nto have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.\nThe reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to\nrescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were\nso beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.\nBuilding stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it\nfelt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled\nby \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in\ncharge of it, but once we started to get user\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\ns, I was converted,\nin much the same way I was converted to \nfatherhood once I had kids.\nWhatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have\nso many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in\nthe meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn't get at the time is that \ngrowth rate is the\nultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about\n70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I\nmistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number\nof users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that\nthat's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough,\nyou might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate\ntakes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was\nadvising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed\nout, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't\nhire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then\nyou'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted\nme to, and partly because that's what startups did during the\nInternet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would\nhave seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about\nwhen Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we\nwere at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.\nAnd since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the\nresult was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb\nstock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable\nand growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had\nno idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of\nthe near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor\nhad I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we\nstarted. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to\nriches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow\n1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were\nby far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must\nhave been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at\nthe time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running\nViaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue\nmy usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue\ncombined with Yahoo's prematurely aged\nculture and grim cube farm\nin Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it\nfelt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of opti\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nons when they bought us. At the\ntime I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth\nanything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next\nyear. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the\nsummer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything\nthat I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been\nentirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had\ndone this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now\nI was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation\nwith me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures\nI wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an\ninterest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.\nMy options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I\nwas leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to\ngo and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people\nwith me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was\nground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving\nthen to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,\nand yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.\nThere was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich.\nNow when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their\ncompanies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's\nwhat I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing\nfor a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or\nambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people\nin California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in\nthe Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from\nanywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation\nI went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent\ncontrol you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed\nup like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and\nthere were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't\nknow any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was\nrich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns,\nexcept now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was\ntired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless\nit was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked\npast charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It\nwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented\nwith a n\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the\nold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and\nthen use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted\nfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually\nchoose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and\nvarious real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by\noccasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there\nwasn't one. Huh.Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear\nfrom our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why\nnot build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit\ncode on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting\napplications for them?\n[9]\nYou could run all sorts of services\non the servers that these applications could use just by making an\nAPI call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images,\ntaking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything\nelse. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly\nwant to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would\nhave to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and\nstart it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but\nthere I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and\nthough he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into\nworking on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.\nSo while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly\nrefused to work on it.Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had\nworked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and\nwe got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty\ncompanies and several open source projects worth of software. The\nlanguage for defining applications would of course be a dialect of\nLisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt\nLisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan\ndid.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an\n\"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long\nbefore it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current\nfor long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going\nto be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network\ninfrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two\nservices (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the\nsummer I realized I really didn't want to run a company  especially\nnot a big one, which it was looking like thi\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\ns would have to be. I'd\nonly started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't\nneed money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be\nrealized as a company, then screw the vision. I'd build a subset\nthat could be done as an open source project.Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not\nwasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often\nencounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and\nit was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and\neven trying to write some of it.The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp,\nwhose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp\nhackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the\ndistinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and\npartly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of\nLisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So\nat the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new\ndialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a\ntalk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp\nat Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,\non paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but\nhad never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.\nWhat on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone\nhad posted it on Slashdot.\n[10]Wow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put\nit on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but\nit was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel\nto readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only\nway to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published\nas a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish\nanything.This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people\nhad realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building\nthe infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer\nas well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it\ntook me several years to understand the implications. It meant there\nwould be a whole new generation of \nessays.\n[11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been\nvanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers\nwho went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed\nto publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.\nThere were so many essays that had never been written, because there\nhad been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\n\nto write them.\n[12]I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there\nwas a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was\nwhen I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that\nwhatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a \nmarginal medium at first.\nSocially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their\nGeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions\npublished in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to\nfind that encouraging instead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how\nwell it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't\nprestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form\nof painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started\nthem. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what\nI'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish\non my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in\nsomething like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when\nyou find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current\nlack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to\nbe discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.\nImpure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is\ngoing to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.\nSo while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee\nyou're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the\nmost common type of wrong one.Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds\nof different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a\nbook, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I\nalso worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to\nhave dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which\ntaught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in\nCambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn\nstudio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\ndiners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one\nparty. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be\npeople they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\ncalled Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.\nThis bank thought it understoo\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\nd startups, but over the next year,\nas she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised\nhow different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So\nshe decided to compile a book of \ninterviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her\nstaff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed\nfor a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make\nup their minds, and during this time I started telling her about\nall the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They\nshould make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a\nhandful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical\nfounders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as\nCEO, and so on.One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks.\nThe prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people\nand tell them something that won't waste their time is a great\nspur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the\nundergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would\ntell them how to start a startup. Maybe they'd be able to avoid the\nworst of the mistakes we'd made.So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the\nbest sources of seed funding were successful startup founders,\nbecause then they'd be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed\nthey were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect\nof having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known),\nI blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk. But afterward\nit occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about\nangel investing. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now\nit was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects\nwe could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed\nlike there had to be something we could collaborate on.As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the\ncorner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged.\nScrew the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We'd\nstart our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd\nbeen talking about. I'd fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and\nwork for it, and we'd get Robert and Trevor as partners too.\n[13]Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to\nbe angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways\nto learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices,\nand some of the things we did turned out to be novel.There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and w\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\ne didn't figure\nthem all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm.\nIn those days, those two words didn't go together. There were VC\nfirms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was\nto make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments.\nAnd there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were\nindividuals who were usually focused on other things and made\ninvestments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough\nin the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects,\nbecause we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing\nJulian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us\nset up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software,\nbut actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all\nthat stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to\nmake seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had\ndone for us.YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we\nfunded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers,\nbut professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got\nall the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular\ninsight on our part. We didn't know how VC firms were organized.\nIt never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we\nwouldn't have known where to start.\n[14]The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a\nbunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three\nmonths focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we\ndiscovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due\nto our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as\ninvestors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch\nof startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech\ncompanies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where\nthey'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being\nin a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense\nbe fake founders. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out\nof it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and\nthey for their part would probably have a more interesting summer\nthan they would working at Microsoft.We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters.\nWe'd all have dinner there once a week  on tuesdays, since I was\nalready cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays  and after\ndinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a\nmatter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders\nProgram, and I posted \nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\nan \nannouncement \non my site, inviting undergrads\nto apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way\nto get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be\nthe perfect source.\n[15]\nWe got 225 applications for the Summer\nFounders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them\nwere from people who'd already graduated, or were about to that\nspring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious\nthan we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and\nfrom those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That\nfirst batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went\non to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the\nRSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access,\nand Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.\nI don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.\nYou had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the\nSummer Founders Program ins\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\n the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bo\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\nttleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders i\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\nt blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and t\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nhat's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of \nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\nresearch papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\n Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for \nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\nWriting Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\n in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\n risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processe\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nd orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, a\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nt least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from \nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\nthem again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\n980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing t\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\nhe\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin \nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\na couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\n asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\n imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to \nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\npaint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\n's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\nBetter organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\nPainting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\nof dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\nbest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\ndefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but oth\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\nerwise I\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A\nrent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\nUpper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\nNow I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\ndays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers\nof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't\nthat much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work\non whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called\nthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited\nhim in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It\nseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical\nuser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.\nI was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\nwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinato\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\nr applications, that\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art\ngalleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy\nones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate\nweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and\nset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up\ngalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.\nIt was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites\nfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that\nexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd\nbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called\nan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy\nof ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write\nsoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to be\nnormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.\nThat was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to\nwrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix\nworld. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new\nsite generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate\nwas away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his\nroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a\nmattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress\nI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran\nthe software on the server, and let users control it by clicking\non links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve\nthem from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at\nthe time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,\nwe decided to try making a version of our store builder that you\ncould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August\n12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you\ncould build a whole store through the browser, without any client\nsoftware or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a\nwhole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't\nneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there\nhad been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to\nbe at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.\nNow you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, a\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\nfter the fact that our\nsoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding\nfrom Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the\ninitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%\nof the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y\nCombinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because\nwe'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand\ndollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by\nwhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside\nthe proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?\nNo, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,\nI needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious\nabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to\nbuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating\npages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be\ngenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,\nthe links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the\nserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online\nstore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking\nlegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts\nand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his\nbedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because\nit's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but\nin 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a\nmonth,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in\nretrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years\nlater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,\nand I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.\nHe recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because\nat that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything\nin his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with\nhim. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a\nfrighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two\nmost independent-minded people \nI know, and in completely different\nways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a\ncolonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's\nit would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just\nas well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were\nlate, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of\ntalk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\n\nwanted online stores.\n[8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which\npeople used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,\nwhich Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and\nstatistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one\nof the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight\nand didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's\nand Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do\nwas work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the\neasiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of\nit stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were\ninstead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second\nhalf of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not\nthe Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It\nwas lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make\nViaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a\nmonth for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low\nprice was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of\ncompetitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we\nset the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.\n$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,\nwe did what's now called \"doing things that \ndon't scale,\" although\nat the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're\ndriven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common\nof which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly\nhumiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that\npeople could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get\nusers.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For\nexample, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt\n(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better\nto have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.\nThe reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to\nrescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were\nso beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.\nBuilding stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it\nfelt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled\nby \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in\ncharge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,\nin much the same way I was converted to \nfatherhood once I had kids.\nWhatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have\nso many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in\nthe meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thin\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\ng I didn't get at the time is that \ngrowth rate is the\nultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about\n70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I\nmistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number\nof users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that\nthat's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough,\nyou might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate\ntakes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was\nadvising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed\nout, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't\nhire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then\nyou'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted\nme to, and partly because that's what startups did during the\nInternet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would\nhave seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about\nwhen Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we\nwere at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.\nAnd since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the\nresult was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb\nstock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable\nand growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had\nno idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of\nthe near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor\nhad I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we\nstarted. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to\nriches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow\n1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were\nby far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must\nhave been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at\nthe time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running\nViaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue\nmy usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue\ncombined with Yahoo's prematurely aged\nculture and grim cube farm\nin Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it\nfelt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the\ntime I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth\nanything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next\nyear. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the\nsummer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything\nthat I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been\nentirely full of software and men's shirts\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\n for 4 years. But I had\ndone this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now\nI was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation\nwith me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures\nI wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an\ninterest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.\nMy options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I\nwas leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to\ngo and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people\nwith me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was\nground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving\nthen to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,\nand yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.\nThere was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich.\nNow when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their\ncompanies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's\nwhat I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing\nfor a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or\nambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people\nin California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in\nthe Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from\nanywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation\nI went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent\ncontrol you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed\nup like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and\nthere were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't\nknow any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was\nrich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns,\nexcept now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was\ntired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless\nit was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked\npast charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It\nwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented\nwith a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the\nold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and\nthen use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted\nfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually\nchoose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and\nvarious real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by\noccasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there\nwasn't one. Huh.Around\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\n this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear\nfrom our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why\nnot build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit\ncode on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting\napplications for them?\n[9]\nYou could run all sorts of services\non the servers that these applications could use just by making an\nAPI call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images,\ntaking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything\nelse. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly\nwant to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would\nhave to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and\nstart it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but\nthere I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and\nthough he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into\nworking on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.\nSo while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly\nrefused to work on it.Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had\nworked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and\nwe got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty\ncompanies and several open source projects worth of software. The\nlanguage for defining applications would of course be a dialect of\nLisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt\nLisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan\ndid.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an\n\"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long\nbefore it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current\nfor long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going\nto be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network\ninfrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two\nservices (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the\nsummer I realized I really didn't want to run a company  especially\nnot a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I'd\nonly started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't\nneed money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be\nrealized as a company, then screw the vision. I'd build a subset\nthat could be done as an open source project.Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not\nwasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often\nencounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and\nit was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and\neven trying to write some of it.The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp,\nwhose parentheses I now wo\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\nuldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp\nhackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the\ndistinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and\npartly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of\nLisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So\nat the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new\ndialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a\ntalk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp\nat Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,\non paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but\nhad never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.\nWhat on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone\nhad posted it on Slashdot.\n[10]Wow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put\nit on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but\nit was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel\nto readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only\nway to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published\nas a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish\nanything.This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people\nhad realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building\nthe infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer\nas well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it\ntook me several years to understand the implications. It meant there\nwould be a whole new generation of \nessays.\n[11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been\nvanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers\nwho went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed\nto publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.\nThere were so many essays that had never been written, because there\nhad been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going\nto write them.\n[12]I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there\nwas a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was\nwhen I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that\nwhatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a \nmarginal medium at first.\nSocially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their\nGeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions\npublished in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to\nfind that encouraging instead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how\nwell it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't\nprestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form\nof painti\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\nng. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started\nthem. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what\nI'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish\non my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in\nsomething like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when\nyou find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current\nlack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to\nbe discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.\nImpure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is\ngoing to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.\nSo while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee\nyou're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the\nmost common type of wrong one.Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds\nof different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a\nbook, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I\nalso worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to\nhave dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which\ntaught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in\nCambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn\nstudio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\ndiners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one\nparty. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be\npeople they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\ncalled Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.\nThis bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,\nas she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised\nhow different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So\nshe decided to compile a book of \ninterviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her\nstaff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed\nfor a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make\nup their minds, and during this time I started telling her about\nall the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They\nshould make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a\nhandful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical\nfounders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as\nCEO, and so on.One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks.\nThe prospect of having to stand up in front of a gr\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\noup of people\nand tell them something that won't waste their time is a great\nspur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the\nundergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would\ntell them how to start a startup. Maybe they'd be able to avoid the\nworst of the mistakes we'd made.So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the\nbest sources of seed funding were successful startup founders,\nbecause then they'd be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed\nthey were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect\nof having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known),\nI blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk. But afterward\nit occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about\nangel investing. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now\nit was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects\nwe could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed\nlike there had to be something we could collaborate on.As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the\ncorner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged.\nScrew the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We'd\nstart our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd\nbeen talking about. I'd fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and\nwork for it, and we'd get Robert and Trevor as partners too.\n[13]Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to\nbe angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways\nto learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices,\nand some of the things we did turned out to be novel.There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn't figure\nthem all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm.\nIn those days, those two words didn't go together. There were VC\nfirms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was\nto make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments.\nAnd there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were\nindividuals who were usually focused on other things and made\ninvestments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough\nin the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects,\nbecause we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing\nJulian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us\nset up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software,\nbut actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all\nthat stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to\nmake seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had\ndone for us.YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run th\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\nat we\nfunded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers,\nbut professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got\nall the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular\ninsight on our part. We didn't know how VC firms were organized.\nIt never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we\nwouldn't have known where to start.\n[14]The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a\nbunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three\nmonths focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we\ndiscovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due\nto our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as\ninvestors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch\nof startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech\ncompanies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where\nthey'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being\nin a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense\nbe fake founders. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out\nof it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and\nthey for their part would probably have a more interesting summer\nthan they would working at Microsoft.We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters.\nWe'd all have dinner there once a week  on tuesdays, since I was\nalready cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays  and after\ndinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a\nmatter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders\nProgram, and I posted an \nannouncement \non my site, inviting undergrads\nto apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way\nto get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be\nthe perfect source.\n[15]\nWe got 225 applications for the Summer\nFounders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them\nwere from people who'd already graduated, or were about to that\nspring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious\nthan we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and\nfrom those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That\nfirst batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went\non to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the\nRSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access,\nand Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.\nI don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.\nYou had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the\nSummer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place\nlike Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\n did\nwith Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students\ngot for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the\ntypical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to\nbe fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had\ntaken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought\nthe founders free air conditioners.\n[16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale\nstartup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient\nfor us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups\nat once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too.\nIt solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the\nisolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who\nunderstood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they\nwere solving them.As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The\nalumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another,\nand especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being\nin. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's\ncustomers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YC\ngrows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups\nget their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their\nbatchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going\nto do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew,\nand I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more\nthan a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was\nstill able to work on other things.In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version\nof Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into\nScheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was\noriginally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and\nwas called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of\nreading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders\nwe wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed\nthe name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's\nintellectual curiosity.HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest\nsource of stress for me.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corp\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\norate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realiz\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\ne that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for rea\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\nding drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an inter\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to wor\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\nk on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\n that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  \nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\nIn a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\n the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit l\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\nater I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.

We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tu\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nb on account of the heat they generated.

RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is n\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figur\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\ne out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed on\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\nly a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\nSo I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make\nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\n art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have b\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\neen a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict informat\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\nion-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave eno\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\nugh to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\nBetter organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\nPainting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\nof dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could d\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\nraw\"\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\nbest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\ndefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A\nrent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\nUpper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\nNow I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\ndays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers\nof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't\nthat much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work\non whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called\nthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited\nhim in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It\nseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical\nuser interfaces had done for \nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\nthe popularity of microcomputers. It\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.\nI was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\nwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art\ngalleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy\nones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate\nweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and\nset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up\ngalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.\nIt was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites\nfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that\nexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd\nbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called\nan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy\nof ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write\nsoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to be\nnormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.\nThat was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to\nwrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix\nworld. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new\nsite generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate\nwas away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his\nroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a\nmattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress\nI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran\nthe software on the server, and let users control it by clicking\non links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve\nthem from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at\nthe time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,\nwe decided to try making a version of our store builder that you\ncould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August\n12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you\ncould build a whole store through the browser, without any client\nsoftware or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a\nwhole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't\nneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there\nhad been a whole \nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\ngroup called Release Engineering that seemed to\nbe at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.\nNow you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our\nsoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding\nfrom Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the\ninitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%\nof the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y\nCombinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because\nwe'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand\ndollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by\nwhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside\nthe proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?\nNo, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,\nI needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious\nabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to\nbuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating\npages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be\ngenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,\nthe links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the\nserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online\nstore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking\nlegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts\nand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his\nbedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because\nit's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but\nin 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a\nmonth,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in\nretrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years\nlater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,\nand I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.\nHe recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because\nat that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything\nin his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with\nhim. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a\nfrighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two\nmost independent-minded people \nI know, and in completely different\nways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a\ncolonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's\nit would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just\nas well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were\nlate, we were actually almost fatally ea\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\nrly. There was a lot of\ntalk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually\nwanted online stores.\n[8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which\npeople used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,\nwhich Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and\nstatistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one\nof the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight\nand didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's\nand Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do\nwas work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the\neasiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of\nit stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were\ninstead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second\nhalf of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not\nthe Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It\nwas lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make\nViaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a\nmonth for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low\nprice was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of\ncompetitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we\nset the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.\n$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,\nwe did what's now called \"doing things that \ndon't scale,\" although\nat the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're\ndriven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common\nof which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly\nhumiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that\npeople could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get\nusers.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For\nexample, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt\n(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better\nto have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.\nThe reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to\nrescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were\nso beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.\nBuilding stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it\nfelt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled\nby \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in\ncharge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,\nin much the same way I was converted to \nfatherhood once I had kids.\nWhatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have\nso many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in\nthe meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn't get at the time is tha\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\nt \ngrowth rate is the\nultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about\n70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I\nmistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number\nof users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that\nthat's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough,\nyou might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate\ntakes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was\nadvising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed\nout, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't\nhire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then\nyou'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted\nme to, and partly because that's what startups did during the\nInternet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would\nhave seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about\nwhen Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we\nwere at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.\nAnd since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the\nresult was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb\nstock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable\nand growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had\nno idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of\nthe near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor\nhad I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we\nstarted. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to\nriches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow\n1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were\nby far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must\nhave been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at\nthe time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running\nViaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue\nmy usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue\ncombined with Yahoo's prematurely aged\nculture and grim cube farm\nin Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it\nfelt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the\ntime I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth\nanything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next\nyear. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the\nsummer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything\nthat I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been\nentirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had\ndone this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now\nI was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\n at Yahoo had a long conversation\nwith me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures\nI wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an\ninterest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.\nMy options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I\nwas leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to\ngo and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people\nwith me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was\nground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving\nthen to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,\nand yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.\nThere was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich.\nNow when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their\ncompanies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's\nwhat I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing\nfor a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or\nambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people\nin California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in\nthe Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from\nanywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation\nI went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent\ncontrol you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed\nup like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and\nthere were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't\nknow any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was\nrich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns,\nexcept now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was\ntired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless\nit was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked\npast charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It\nwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented\nwith a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the\nold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and\nthen use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted\nfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually\nchoose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and\nvarious real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by\noccasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there\nwasn't one. Huh.Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear\nfrom our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why\nnot build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit\ncode on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting\napplications for the\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\nm?\n[9]\nYou could run all sorts of services\non the servers that these applications could use just by making an\nAPI call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images,\ntaking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything\nelse. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly\nwant to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would\nhave to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and\nstart it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but\nthere I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and\nthough he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into\nworking on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.\nSo while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly\nrefused to work on it.Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had\nworked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and\nwe got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty\ncompanies and several open source projects worth of software. The\nlanguage for defining applications would of course be a dialect of\nLisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt\nLisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan\ndid.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an\n\"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long\nbefore it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current\nfor long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going\nto be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network\ninfrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two\nservices (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the\nsummer I realized I really didn't want to run a company  especially\nnot a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I'd\nonly started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't\nneed money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be\nrealized as a company, then screw the vision. I'd build a subset\nthat could be done as an open source project.Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not\nwasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often\nencounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and\nit was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and\neven trying to write some of it.The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp,\nwhose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp\nhackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the\ndistinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and\npartly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of\nLisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So\nat the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new\ndialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in \nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\na house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a\ntalk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp\nat Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,\non paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but\nhad never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.\nWhat on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone\nhad posted it on Slashdot.\n[10]Wow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put\nit on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but\nit was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel\nto readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only\nway to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published\nas a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish\nanything.This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people\nhad realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building\nthe infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer\nas well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it\ntook me several years to understand the implications. It meant there\nwould be a whole new generation of \nessays.\n[11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been\nvanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers\nwho went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed\nto publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.\nThere were so many essays that had never been written, because there\nhad been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going\nto write them.\n[12]I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there\nwas a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was\nwhen I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that\nwhatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a \nmarginal medium at first.\nSocially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their\nGeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions\npublished in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to\nfind that encouraging instead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how\nwell it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't\nprestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form\nof painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started\nthem. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what\nI'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish\non my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in\nsomething like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when\nyou find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current\nlack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to\nbe discovered there\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\n, and that you have the right kind of motives.\nImpure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is\ngoing to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.\nSo while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee\nyou're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the\nmost common type of wrong one.Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds\nof different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a\nbook, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I\nalso worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to\nhave dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which\ntaught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in\nCambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn\nstudio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\ndiners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one\nparty. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be\npeople they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\ncalled Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.\nThis bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,\nas she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised\nhow different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So\nshe decided to compile a book of \ninterviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her\nstaff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed\nfor a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make\nup their minds, and during this time I started telling her about\nall the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They\nshould make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a\nhandful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical\nfounders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as\nCEO, and so on.One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks.\nThe prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people\nand tell them something that won't waste their time is a great\nspur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the\nundergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would\ntell them how to start a startup. Maybe they'd be able to avoid the\nworst of the mistakes we'd made.So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the\nbest sources of seed funding were successful startup founders,\nbecause then they'd be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed\nthey were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect\nof having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known),\nI blurted out \"But not \nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\nme!\" and went on with the talk. But afterward\nit occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about\nangel investing. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now\nit was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects\nwe could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed\nlike there had to be something we could collaborate on.As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the\ncorner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged.\nScrew the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We'd\nstart our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd\nbeen talking about. I'd fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and\nwork for it, and we'd get Robert and Trevor as partners too.\n[13]Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to\nbe angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways\nto learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices,\nand some of the things we did turned out to be novel.There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn't figure\nthem all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm.\nIn those days, those two words didn't go together. There were VC\nfirms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was\nto make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments.\nAnd there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were\nindividuals who were usually focused on other things and made\ninvestments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough\nin the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects,\nbecause we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing\nJulian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us\nset up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software,\nbut actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all\nthat stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to\nmake seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had\ndone for us.YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we\nfunded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers,\nbut professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got\nall the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular\ninsight on our part. We didn't know how VC firms were organized.\nIt never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we\nwouldn't have known where to start.\n[14]The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a\nbunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three\nmonths focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we\ndiscovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due\nto our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as\ninvestors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch\nof startup\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\ns at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech\ncompanies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where\nthey'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being\nin a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense\nbe fake founders. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out\nof it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and\nthey for their part would probably have a more interesting summer\nthan they would working at Microsoft.We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters.\nWe'd all have dinner there once a week  on tuesdays, since I was\nalready cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays  and after\ndinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a\nmatter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders\nProgram, and I posted an \nannouncement \non my site, inviting undergrads\nto apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way\nto get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be\nthe perfect source.\n[15]\nWe got 225 applications for the Summer\nFounders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them\nwere from people who'd already graduated, or were about to that\nspring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious\nthan we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and\nfrom those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That\nfirst batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went\non to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the\nRSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access,\nand Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.\nI don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.\nYou had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the\nSummer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place\nlike Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did\nwith Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students\ngot for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the\ntypical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to\nbe fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had\ntaken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought\nthe founders free air conditioners.\n[16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale\nstartup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient\nfor us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups\nat once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too.\nIt solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the\nisolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who\nunderstood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they\nwere solving them.As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages o\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\nf scale. The\nalumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another,\nand especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being\nin. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's\ncustomers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YC\ngrows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups\nget their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their\nbatchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going\nto do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew,\nand I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more\nthan a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was\nstill able to work on other things.In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version\nof Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into\nScheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was\noriginally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and\nwas called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of\nreading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders\nwe wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed\nthe name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's\nintellectual curiosity.HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest\nsource of stress for me. If all I'd had to do was select and help\nfounders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN\nwas a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work\nshould at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas\nI was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not\nfrom the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an\nill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during\nYC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40%\nchance it had do with everything else combined.\n[17]As well as HN, I wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc. But\nwhile I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped\nworking on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly\nbecause it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language\nnow that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my\nthree projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on\nYC.YC was different from other kinds of work I've done. Instead of\ndeciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every\n6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems,\nwhatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work,\nbecause their problems were quite varied, and the good founders\nwere very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could\nabout startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have\npicked a better way to do it.There were parts of the job I didn't like. Disputes between cofounders,\nfiguring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who\nmaltreated the sta\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\nrtups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the\nparts I didn't like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once\nsaid about companies: \"No one works harder than the boss.\" He meant\nit both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second\npart that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked\nset the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better\nwork very hard.One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews,\nRobert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited\nadvice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at\nViaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested\nthat it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital.\nThat was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I\nremember his exact words very clearly. \"You know,\" he said, \"you\nshould make sure Y Combinator isn't the last cool thing you do.\"At the time I didn't understand what he meant, but gradually it\ndawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange\nadvice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer\nthan Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me\nthinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be\nthe last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my\nattention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of\neating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave\neventually. And it wasn't, so I would.In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned\nout to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed\nher balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really\nwanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I\nwere determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to\nvisit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those\nflights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to\nsomeone else.I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so\nwe decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and\nTrevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard.\nUp till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we\nfour had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to\ndo that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said\nyes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and\nJessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he\nsaid no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors.\nBut I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided\nhe'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest\nof 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could\nlearn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose\ncancer had returned.She died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was\nstill hard when\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\n it did.I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups\nthrough Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still\ntalk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested\nin, but that only takes a few hours a week.)What should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about\nthat. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided\nI'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused\non it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting.\nI was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was\nat least completely engaging.\n[18]I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to\nwork so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had\nbeen. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the\nmiddle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd\nalways been curious to see how the painting I was working on would\nturn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So\nI stop\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think \nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\nthat responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\n the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people ca\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\nn't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\n there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciti\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\nng new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\n  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I \nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\ncompletely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old \nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\nnews to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get u\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\ns mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it wo\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nuld amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay be\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\ncome common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to pre\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\ndict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bother\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\ned me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In th\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\nis dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. R\nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\nISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was al\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\nl I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn'\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\nt know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\nBetter organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\nPainting students were s\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\nupposed to express themselves, which to the\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\nof dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\nbest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\ndefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A\nrent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\nUpper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\nNow I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\ndays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers\nof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a \nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\nside.\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't\nthat much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work\non whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called\nthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited\nhim in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It\nseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical\nuser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.\nI was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\nwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art\ngalleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy\nones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate\nweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and\nset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up\ngalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.\nIt was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites\nfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that\nexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd\nbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called\nan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy\nof ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write\nsoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to be\nnormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.\nThat was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to\nwrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix\nworld. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new\nsite generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate\nwas away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his\nroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a\nmattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress\nI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran\nthe software on the server, and let users control it by clicking\non links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve\nthem from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at\nthe time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,\nwe decided to try making a version of our store builder that you\ncould con\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\ntrol through the browser. A couple days later, on August\n12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you\ncould build a whole store through the browser, without any client\nsoftware or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a\nwhole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't\nneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there\nhad been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to\nbe at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.\nNow you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our\nsoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding\nfrom Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the\ninitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%\nof the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y\nCombinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because\nwe'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand\ndollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by\nwhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside\nthe proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?\nNo, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,\nI needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious\nabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to\nbuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating\npages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be\ngenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,\nthe links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the\nserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online\nstore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking\nlegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts\nand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his\nbedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because\nit's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but\nin 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a\nmonth,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in\nretrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years\nlater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,\nand I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.\nHe recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because\nat that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything\nin his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with\nhim. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a\nfrighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two\nmost independent-minded people \nI know, and in completely different\nways. If you could s\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\nee inside Rtm's brain it would look like a\ncolonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's\nit would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just\nas well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were\nlate, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of\ntalk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually\nwanted online stores.\n[8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which\npeople used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,\nwhich Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and\nstatistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one\nof the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight\nand didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's\nand Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do\nwas work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the\neasiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of\nit stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were\ninstead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second\nhalf of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not\nthe Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It\nwas lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make\nViaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a\nmonth for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low\nprice was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of\ncompetitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we\nset the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.\n$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,\nwe did what's now called \"doing things that \ndon't scale,\" although\nat the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're\ndriven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common\nof which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly\nhumiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that\npeople could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get\nusers.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For\nexample, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt\n(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better\nto have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.\nThe reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to\nrescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were\nso beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.\nBuilding stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it\nfelt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled\nby \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in\ncharge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,\nin much the same way I was converted to \nfatherhood once I had kids.\nWhatever u\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\nsers wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have\nso many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in\nthe meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn't get at the time is that \ngrowth rate is the\nultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about\n70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I\nmistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number\nof users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that\nthat's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough,\nyou might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate\ntakes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was\nadvising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed\nout, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't\nhire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then\nyou'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted\nme to, and partly because that's what startups did during the\nInternet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would\nhave seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about\nwhen Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we\nwere at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.\nAnd since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the\nresult was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb\nstock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable\nand growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had\nno idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of\nthe near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor\nhad I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we\nstarted. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to\nriches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow\n1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were\nby far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must\nhave been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at\nthe time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running\nViaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue\nmy usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue\ncombined with Yahoo's prematurely aged\nculture and grim cube farm\nin Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it\nfelt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the\ntime I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth\nanything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next\nyear. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the\nsummer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything\nthat I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been\nentirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had\ndone this to get rich so I could paint, I \nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\nreminded myself, and now\nI was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation\nwith me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures\nI wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an\ninterest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.\nMy options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I\nwas leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to\ngo and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people\nwith me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was\nground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving\nthen to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,\nand yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.\nThere was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich.\nNow when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their\ncompanies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's\nwhat I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing\nfor a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or\nambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people\nin California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in\nthe Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from\nanywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation\nI went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent\ncontrol you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed\nup like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and\nthere were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't\nknow any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was\nrich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns,\nexcept now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was\ntired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless\nit was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked\npast charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It\nwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented\nwith a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the\nold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and\nthen use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted\nfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually\nchoose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and\nvarious real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by\noccasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there\nwasn't one. Huh.Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear\nfrom our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why\nnot build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit\ncode on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting\napplications for them?\n[9]\nYou could run all sorts of\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\n services\non the servers that these applications could use just by making an\nAPI call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images,\ntaking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything\nelse. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly\nwant to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would\nhave to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and\nstart it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but\nthere I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and\nthough he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into\nworking on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.\nSo while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly\nrefused to work on it.Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had\nworked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and\nwe got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty\ncompanies and several open source projects worth of software. The\nlanguage for defining applications would of course be a dialect of\nLisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt\nLisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan\ndid.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an\n\"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long\nbefore it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current\nfor long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going\nto be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network\ninfrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two\nservices (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the\nsummer I realized I really didn't want to run a company  especially\nnot a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I'd\nonly started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't\nneed money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be\nrealized as a company, then screw the vision. I'd build a subset\nthat could be done as an open source project.Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not\nwasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often\nencounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and\nit was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and\neven trying to write some of it.The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp,\nwhose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp\nhackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the\ndistinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and\npartly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of\nLisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So\nat the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new\ndialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a\ntalk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lis\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\np\nat Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,\non paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but\nhad never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.\nWhat on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone\nhad posted it on Slashdot.\n[10]Wow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put\nit on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but\nit was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel\nto readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only\nway to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published\nas a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish\nanything.This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people\nhad realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building\nthe infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer\nas well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it\ntook me several years to understand the implications. It meant there\nwould be a whole new generation of \nessays.\n[11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been\nvanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers\nwho went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed\nto publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.\nThere were so many essays that had never been written, because there\nhad been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going\nto write them.\n[12]I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there\nwas a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was\nwhen I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that\nwhatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a \nmarginal medium at first.\nSocially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their\nGeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions\npublished in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to\nfind that encouraging instead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how\nwell it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't\nprestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form\nof painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started\nthem. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what\nI'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish\non my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in\nsomething like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when\nyou find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current\nlack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to\nbe discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.\nImpure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is\ngoing to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.\nSo while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee\nyou're on the right track, it at le\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nast guarantees you're not on the\nmost common type of wrong one.Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds\nof different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a\nbook, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I\nalso worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to\nhave dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which\ntaught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in\nCambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn\nstudio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\ndiners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one\nparty. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be\npeople they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\ncalled Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.\nThis bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,\nas she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised\nhow different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So\nshe decided to compile a book of \ninterviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her\nstaff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed\nfor a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make\nup their minds, and during this time I started telling her about\nall the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They\nshould make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a\nhandful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical\nfounders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as\nCEO, and so on.One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks.\nThe prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people\nand tell them something that won't waste their time is a great\nspur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the\nundergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would\ntell them how to start a startup. Maybe they'd be able to avoid the\nworst of the mistakes we'd made.So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the\nbest sources of seed funding were successful startup founders,\nbecause then they'd be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed\nthey were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect\nof having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known),\nI blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk. But afterward\nit occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about\nangel investing. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now\nit was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects\nwe could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed\nlike there had to be somet\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\nhing we could collaborate on.As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the\ncorner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged.\nScrew the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We'd\nstart our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd\nbeen talking about. I'd fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and\nwork for it, and we'd get Robert and Trevor as partners too.\n[13]Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to\nbe angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways\nto learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices,\nand some of the things we did turned out to be novel.There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn't figure\nthem all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm.\nIn those days, those two words didn't go together. There were VC\nfirms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was\nto make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments.\nAnd there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were\nindividuals who were usually focused on other things and made\ninvestments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough\nin the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects,\nbecause we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing\nJulian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us\nset up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software,\nbut actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all\nthat stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to\nmake seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had\ndone for us.YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we\nfunded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers,\nbut professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got\nall the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular\ninsight on our part. We didn't know how VC firms were organized.\nIt never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we\nwouldn't have known where to start.\n[14]The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a\nbunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three\nmonths focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we\ndiscovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due\nto our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as\ninvestors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch\nof startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech\ncompanies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where\nthey'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being\nin a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense\nbe fake founders. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out\nof it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and\nthey for their part would probably have a more interesting summer\nthan they would working at Microsoft.We'd use the building I owned in Cambridg\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\ne as our headquarters.\nWe'd all have dinner there once a week  on tuesdays, since I was\nalready cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays  and after\ndinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a\nmatter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders\nProgram, and I posted an \nannouncement \non my site, inviting undergrads\nto apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way\nto get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be\nthe perfect source.\n[15]\nWe got 225 applications for the Summer\nFounders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them\nwere from people who'd already graduated, or were about to that\nspring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious\nthan we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and\nfrom those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That\nfirst batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went\non to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the\nRSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access,\nand Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.\nI don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.\nYou had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the\nSummer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place\nlike Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did\nwith Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students\ngot for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the\ntypical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to\nbe fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had\ntaken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought\nthe founders free air conditioners.\n[16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale\nstartup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient\nfor us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups\nat once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too.\nIt solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the\nisolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who\nunderstood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they\nwere solving them.As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The\nalumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another,\nand especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being\nin. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's\ncustomers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YC\ngrows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups\nget their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their\nbatchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going\nto do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew,\nand I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more\nthan a third of my attention. But \nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\nfor the first few years I was\nstill able to work on other things.In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version\nof Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into\nScheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was\noriginally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and\nwas called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of\nreading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders\nwe wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed\nthe name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's\nintellectual curiosity.HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest\nsource of stress for me. If all I'd had to do was select and help\nfounders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN\nwas a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work\nshould at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas\nI was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not\nfrom the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an\nill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during\nYC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40%\nchance it had do with everything else combined.\n[17]As well as HN, I wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc. But\nwhile I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped\nworking on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly\nbecause it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language\nnow that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my\nthree projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on\nYC.YC was different from other kinds of work I've done. Instead of\ndeciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every\n6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems,\nwhatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work,\nbecause their problems were quite varied, and the good founders\nwere very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could\nabout startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have\npicked a better way to do it.There were parts of the job I didn't like. Disputes between cofounders,\nfiguring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who\nmaltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the\nparts I didn't like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once\nsaid about companies: \"No one works harder than the boss.\" He meant\nit both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second\npart that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked\nset the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better\nwork very hard.One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews,\nRobert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited\nadvice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at\nViaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested\nthat it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital.\nThat was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\n. So I\nremember his exact words very clearly. \"You know,\" he said, \"you\nshould make sure Y Combinator isn't the last cool thing you do.\"At the time I didn't understand what he meant, but gradually it\ndawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange\nadvice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer\nthan Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me\nthinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be\nthe last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my\nattention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of\neating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave\neventually. And it wasn't, so I would.In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned\nout to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed\nher balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really\nwanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I\nwere determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to\nvisit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those\nflights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to\nsomeone else.I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so\nwe decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and\nTrevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard.\nUp till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we\nfour had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to\ndo that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said\nyes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and\nJessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he\nsaid no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors.\nBut I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided\nhe'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest\nof 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could\nlearn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose\ncancer had returned.She died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was\nstill hard when it did.I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups\nthrough Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still\ntalk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested\nin, but that only takes a few hours a week.)What should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about\nthat. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided\nI'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused\non it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting.\nI was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was\nat least completely engaging.\n[18]I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to\nwork so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had\nbeen. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the\nmiddle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd\nalways been curious to\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\n see how the painting I was working on would\nturn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So\nI stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted\nsince. So far anyway.I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum\ngame. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project\nthat's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's\ngetting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was\nsome opportunity cost to screwing around.I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over\nthe next few months. I even wrote a couple that \nweren't about\nstartups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language\ndefined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally\nintended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was\nmeant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the\nTuring machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language\nin itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need?\nThe Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered,\nis an answer to that question.\n[19]McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program\ncomputers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell\ntranslated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language,\nand from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language\nin the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation\ngave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.\nIt was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand\nwhy at the time.McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions.\nIt was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language.\nSo these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined\nusing McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have\nbeen feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by\nhand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting\nclose to the limit of interpreters you could test that way  indeed,\nthere was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more\ncomplicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers\nthen weren't powerful enough.Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's\naxiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language.\nAnd as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a\ndiscoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle,\nend up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to\ndo than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle,\nwhy not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years,\nfrom March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I\nhad a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep\nat it for so long.I wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, \nin itself in Arc. That may sound\nlike a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery\nI had to engage in to make this w\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\nork. By means of an egregious\ncollection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an\ninterpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast,\nbut fast enough to test.I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time,\nor I'd never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing\nessays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely\nunderstand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as\nbecause the problem is so convoluted. When you're working on an\ninterpreter written in itself, it's hard to keep track of what's\nhappening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted\nby the time you get them.So I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people\nabout Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have\nseemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder\nthan I'd ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for\nhours with some gruesome bug I'd check Twitter or HN and see someone\nasking \"Does Paul Graham still\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis rem\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\nark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem sh\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\nocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance \nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\nwith the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they coul\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nd do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\n?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writi\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\nng differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in comput\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\national\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional w\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\nisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\n who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget th\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\ne experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then sta\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nck them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd h\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\nave Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I \nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\ndecided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multip\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\nle projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\nd\nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\nepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\n, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nb\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\nack to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\nBetter organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\nPainting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\nof dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\nbest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\ndefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A\nrent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\nUpper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\nNow I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\nd\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\nays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers\nof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't\nthat much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work\non whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called\nthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited\nhim in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It\nseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical\nuser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.\nI was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\nwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art\ngalleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy\nones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate\nweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and\nset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up\ngalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.\nIt was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites\nfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that\nexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd\nbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called\nan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy\nof ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write\nsoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to be\nnormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.\nThat was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to\nwrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix\nworld. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new\nsite generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate\nwas away for\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\n big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his\nroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a\nmattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress\nI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran\nthe software on the server, and let users control it by clicking\non links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve\nthem from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at\nthe time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,\nwe decided to try making a version of our store builder that you\ncould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August\n12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you\ncould build a whole store through the browser, without any client\nsoftware or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a\nwhole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't\nneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there\nhad been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to\nbe at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.\nNow you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our\nsoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding\nfrom Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the\ninitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%\nof the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y\nCombinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because\nwe'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand\ndollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by\nwhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside\nthe proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?\nNo, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,\nI needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious\nabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to\nbuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating\npages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be\ngenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,\nthe links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the\nserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online\nstore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking\nlegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts\nand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his\nbedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because\nit's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but\nin 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a\nmonth,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in\nretrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\n\nlater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,\nand I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.\nHe recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because\nat that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything\nin his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with\nhim. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a\nfrighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two\nmost independent-minded people \nI know, and in completely different\nways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a\ncolonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's\nit would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just\nas well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were\nlate, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of\ntalk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually\nwanted online stores.\n[8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which\npeople used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,\nwhich Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and\nstatistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one\nof the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight\nand didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's\nand Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do\nwas work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the\neasiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of\nit stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were\ninstead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second\nhalf of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not\nthe Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It\nwas lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make\nViaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a\nmonth for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low\nprice was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of\ncompetitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we\nset the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.\n$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,\nwe did what's now called \"doing things that \ndon't scale,\" although\nat the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're\ndriven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common\nof which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly\nhumiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that\npeople could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get\nusers.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For\nexample, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt\n(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better\nto have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.\nThe reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to\nrescan about 30 images of men's\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\n shirts. My first set of scans were\nso beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.\nBuilding stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it\nfelt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled\nby \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in\ncharge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,\nin much the same way I was converted to \nfatherhood once I had kids.\nWhatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have\nso many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in\nthe meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn't get at the time is that \ngrowth rate is the\nultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about\n70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I\nmistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number\nof users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that\nthat's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough,\nyou might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate\ntakes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was\nadvising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed\nout, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't\nhire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then\nyou'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted\nme to, and partly because that's what startups did during the\nInternet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would\nhave seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about\nwhen Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we\nwere at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.\nAnd since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the\nresult was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb\nstock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable\nand growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had\nno idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of\nthe near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor\nhad I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we\nstarted. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to\nriches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow\n1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were\nby far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must\nhave been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at\nthe time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running\nViaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue\nmy usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue\ncombined with Yahoo's prematurely aged\nculture and grim cube farm\nin Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it\nfelt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the\ntime I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth\nanything, but to my astonishment t\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\nhe stock went up 5x in the next\nyear. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the\nsummer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything\nthat I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been\nentirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had\ndone this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now\nI was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation\nwith me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures\nI wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an\ninterest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.\nMy options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I\nwas leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to\ngo and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people\nwith me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was\nground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving\nthen to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,\nand yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.\nThere was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich.\nNow when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their\ncompanies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's\nwhat I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing\nfor a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or\nambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people\nin California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in\nthe Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from\nanywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation\nI went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent\ncontrol you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed\nup like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and\nthere were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't\nknow any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was\nrich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns,\nexcept now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was\ntired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless\nit was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked\npast charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It\nwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented\nwith a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the\nold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and\nthen use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted\nfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually\nchoose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and\nvarious real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by\noccasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there\nwasn't one. Huh.Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear\nfrom our experience with Viaweb that\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\n web apps were the future. Why\nnot build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit\ncode on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting\napplications for them?\n[9]\nYou could run all sorts of services\non the servers that these applications could use just by making an\nAPI call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images,\ntaking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything\nelse. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly\nwant to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would\nhave to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and\nstart it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but\nthere I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and\nthough he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into\nworking on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.\nSo while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly\nrefused to work on it.Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had\nworked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and\nwe got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty\ncompanies and several open source projects worth of software. The\nlanguage for defining applications would of course be a dialect of\nLisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt\nLisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan\ndid.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an\n\"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long\nbefore it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current\nfor long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going\nto be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network\ninfrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two\nservices (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the\nsummer I realized I really didn't want to run a company  especially\nnot a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I'd\nonly started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't\nneed money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be\nrealized as a company, then screw the vision. I'd build a subset\nthat could be done as an open source project.Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not\nwasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often\nencounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and\nit was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and\neven trying to write some of it.The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp,\nwhose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp\nhackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the\ndistinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and\npartly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of\nLisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So\nat the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new\ndialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning stru\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\nck. I was invited to give a\ntalk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp\nat Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,\non paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but\nhad never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.\nWhat on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone\nhad posted it on Slashdot.\n[10]Wow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put\nit on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but\nit was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel\nto readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only\nway to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published\nas a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish\nanything.This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people\nhad realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building\nthe infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer\nas well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it\ntook me several years to understand the implications. It meant there\nwould be a whole new generation of \nessays.\n[11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been\nvanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers\nwho went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed\nto publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.\nThere were so many essays that had never been written, because there\nhad been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going\nto write them.\n[12]I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there\nwas a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was\nwhen I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that\nwhatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a \nmarginal medium at first.\nSocially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their\nGeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions\npublished in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to\nfind that encouraging instead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how\nwell it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't\nprestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form\nof painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started\nthem. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what\nI'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish\non my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in\nsomething like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when\nyou find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current\nlack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to\nbe discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.\nImpure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is\ngoing to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.\nSo while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee\nyou're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the\n\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\nmost common type of wrong one.Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds\nof different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a\nbook, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I\nalso worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to\nhave dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which\ntaught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in\nCambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn\nstudio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\ndiners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one\nparty. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be\npeople they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\ncalled Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.\nThis bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,\nas she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised\nhow different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So\nshe decided to compile a book of \ninterviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her\nstaff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed\nfor a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make\nup their minds, and during this time I started telling her about\nall the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They\nshould make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a\nhandful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical\nfounders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as\nCEO, and so on.One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks.\nThe prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people\nand tell them something that won't waste their time is a great\nspur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the\nundergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would\ntell them how to start a startup. Maybe they'd be able to avoid the\nworst of the mistakes we'd made.So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the\nbest sources of seed funding were successful startup founders,\nbecause then they'd be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed\nthey were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect\nof having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known),\nI blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk. But afterward\nit occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about\nangel investing. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now\nit was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects\nwe could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed\nlike there had to be something we could collaborate on.As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the\ncorner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads conver\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nged.\nScrew the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We'd\nstart our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd\nbeen talking about. I'd fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and\nwork for it, and we'd get Robert and Trevor as partners too.\n[13]Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to\nbe angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways\nto learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices,\nand some of the things we did turned out to be novel.There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn't figure\nthem all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm.\nIn those days, those two words didn't go together. There were VC\nfirms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was\nto make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments.\nAnd there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were\nindividuals who were usually focused on other things and made\ninvestments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough\nin the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects,\nbecause we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing\nJulian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us\nset up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software,\nbut actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all\nthat stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to\nmake seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had\ndone for us.YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we\nfunded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers,\nbut professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got\nall the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular\ninsight on our part. We didn't know how VC firms were organized.\nIt never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we\nwouldn't have known where to start.\n[14]The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a\nbunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three\nmonths focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we\ndiscovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due\nto our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as\ninvestors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch\nof startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech\ncompanies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where\nthey'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being\nin a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense\nbe fake founders. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out\nof it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and\nthey for their part would probably have a more interesting summer\nthan they would working at Microsoft.We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters.\nWe'd all have dinner there once a week  on tuesdays, since I was\nalready cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays  and after\ndinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a\nmatter of \nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\ndays we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders\nProgram, and I posted an \nannouncement \non my site, inviting undergrads\nto apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way\nto get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be\nthe perfect source.\n[15]\nWe got 225 applications for the Summer\nFounders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them\nwere from people who'd already graduated, or were about to that\nspring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious\nthan we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and\nfrom those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That\nfirst batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went\non to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the\nRSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access,\nand Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.\nI don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.\nYou had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the\nSummer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place\nlike Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did\nwith Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students\ngot for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the\ntypical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to\nbe fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had\ntaken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought\nthe founders free air conditioners.\n[16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale\nstartup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient\nfor us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups\nat once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too.\nIt solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the\nisolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who\nunderstood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they\nwere solving them.As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The\nalumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another,\nand especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being\nin. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's\ncustomers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YC\ngrows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups\nget their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their\nbatchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going\nto do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew,\nand I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more\nthan a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was\nstill able to work on other things.In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version\nof Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into\nScheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was\noriginally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and\nwas called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of\nreading about n\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders\nwe wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed\nthe name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's\nintellectual curiosity.HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest\nsource of stress for me. If all I'd had to do was select and help\nfounders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN\nwas a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work\nshould at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas\nI was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not\nfrom the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an\nill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during\nYC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40%\nchance it had do with everything else combined.\n[17]As well as HN, I wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc. But\nwhile I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped\nworking on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly\nbecause it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language\nnow that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my\nthree projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on\nYC.YC was different from other kinds of work I've done. Instead of\ndeciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every\n6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems,\nwhatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work,\nbecause their problems were quite varied, and the good founders\nwere very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could\nabout startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have\npicked a better way to do it.There were parts of the job I didn't like. Disputes between cofounders,\nfiguring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who\nmaltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the\nparts I didn't like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once\nsaid about companies: \"No one works harder than the boss.\" He meant\nit both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second\npart that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked\nset the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better\nwork very hard.One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews,\nRobert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited\nadvice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at\nViaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested\nthat it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital.\nThat was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I\nremember his exact words very clearly. \"You know,\" he said, \"you\nshould make sure Y Combinator isn't the last cool thing you do.\"At the time I didn't understand what he meant, but gradually it\ndawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange\nadvice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer\nthan Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me\nthinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be\nthe last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my\natten\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\ntion. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of\neating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave\neventually. And it wasn't, so I would.In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned\nout to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed\nher balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really\nwanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I\nwere determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to\nvisit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those\nflights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to\nsomeone else.I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so\nwe decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and\nTrevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard.\nUp till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we\nfour had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to\ndo that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said\nyes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and\nJessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he\nsaid no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors.\nBut I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided\nhe'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest\nof 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could\nlearn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose\ncancer had returned.She died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was\nstill hard when it did.I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups\nthrough Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still\ntalk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested\nin, but that only takes a few hours a week.)What should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about\nthat. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided\nI'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused\non it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting.\nI was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was\nat least completely engaging.\n[18]I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to\nwork so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had\nbeen. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the\nmiddle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd\nalways been curious to see how the painting I was working on would\nturn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So\nI stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted\nsince. So far anyway.I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum\ngame. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project\nthat's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's\ngetting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was\nsome opportunity cost to screwing around.I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over\nthe next few months. I even wrote a couple that \nweren't about\nstartups. Then in March \nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\n2015 I started working on Lisp again.The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language\ndefined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally\nintended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was\nmeant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the\nTuring machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language\nin itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need?\nThe Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered,\nis an answer to that question.\n[19]McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program\ncomputers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell\ntranslated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language,\nand from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language\nin the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation\ngave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.\nIt was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand\nwhy at the time.McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions.\nIt was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language.\nSo these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined\nusing McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have\nbeen feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by\nhand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting\nclose to the limit of interpreters you could test that way  indeed,\nthere was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more\ncomplicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers\nthen weren't powerful enough.Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's\naxiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language.\nAnd as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a\ndiscoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle,\nend up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to\ndo than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle,\nwhy not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years,\nfrom March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I\nhad a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep\nat it for so long.I wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, \nin itself in Arc. That may sound\nlike a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery\nI had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious\ncollection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an\ninterpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast,\nbut fast enough to test.I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time,\nor I'd never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing\nessays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely\nunderstand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as\nbecause the problem is so convoluted. When you're working on an\ninterpreter written in itself, it's hard to keep track of what's\nhappening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted\nby the time you get them.So I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people\nabout Bel while I was working on it. So for years it m\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\nust have\nseemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder\nthan I'd ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for\nhours with some gruesome bug I'd check Twitter or HN and see someone\nasking \"Does Paul Graham still code?\"Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively\nthat at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head\nand could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the\ncoast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some\nproblem involving continuations while I watched them play in the\ntide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that\nbecause I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news\nis that I had more moments like this over the next few years.In the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to\nsee what it was like living in another country, and since I was a\nBritish citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only\nmeant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still\nlive there. So most of Bel was written in England.In the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's\noriginal Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although\nlike McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics\nI'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also\nstarted to think about other things I could work on. How should I\nchoose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the\npast? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I\nwas surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If\nthis surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would\nbe interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with\nsimilarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others\nto read, and this is the last sentence of it.\nNotes[1]\nMy experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers:\ntime-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from\nbatch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem\nall the more exciting.[2]\nItalian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be\npredicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps\nlike polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you\nstring together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs,\nyou can make a little Italian go a long way.[3]\nI lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia\nwent straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across\nthe bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery,\nand then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at\nstreet level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter\nevenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with\ntourists.[4]\nYou can of course paint people like still lives if you want\nto, and they're willing.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\n\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\n as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about deali\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\nng with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with cl\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\narifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\n this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find t\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\nhat  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never \nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\nhappen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Compan\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\ny\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.

The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releas\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\nes, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do s\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nomething again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in f\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nront of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\n the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\n a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation mea\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\nns the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emph\nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\nasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learn\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\ned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\nBetter organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\nPainting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\nof dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\nbest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\ndefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color cla\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\nss I took at RISD, but otherwise I\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A\nrent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\nUpper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\nNow I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\ndays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers\nof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't\nthat much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work\non whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called\nthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited\nhim in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It\nseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical\nuser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.\nI was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\nwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art\ngalleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy\nones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate\nweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and\nset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up\ngalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.\nIt was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\n make sites\nfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that\nexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd\nbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called\nan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy\nof ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write\nsoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to be\nnormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.\nThat was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to\nwrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix\nworld. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new\nsite generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate\nwas away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his\nroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a\nmattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress\nI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran\nthe software on the server, and let users control it by clicking\non links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve\nthem from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at\nthe time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,\nwe decided to try making a version of our store builder that you\ncould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August\n12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you\ncould build a whole store through the browser, without any client\nsoftware or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a\nwhole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't\nneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there\nhad been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to\nbe at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.\nNow you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our\nsoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding\nfrom Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the\ninitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%\nof the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y\nCombinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because\nwe'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand\ndollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by\nwhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside\nthe proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?\nNo, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,\nI needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious\nabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to\nbuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating\npages, they looked exactly l\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\nike the static ones that would be\ngenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,\nthe links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the\nserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online\nstore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking\nlegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts\nand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his\nbedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because\nit's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but\nin 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a\nmonth,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in\nretrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years\nlater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,\nand I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.\nHe recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because\nat that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything\nin his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with\nhim. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a\nfrighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two\nmost independent-minded people \nI know, and in completely different\nways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a\ncolonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's\nit would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just\nas well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were\nlate, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of\ntalk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually\nwanted online stores.\n[8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which\npeople used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,\nwhich Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and\nstatistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one\nof the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight\nand didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's\nand Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do\nwas work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the\neasiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of\nit stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were\ninstead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second\nhalf of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not\nthe Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It\nwas lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make\nViaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a\nmonth for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low\nprice was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of\ncompetitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we\nset the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.\n$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,\nwe did what's now called \"doing things that \ndon't sc\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\nale,\" although\nat the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're\ndriven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common\nof which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly\nhumiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that\npeople could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get\nusers.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For\nexample, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt\n(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better\nto have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.\nThe reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to\nrescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were\nso beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.\nBuilding stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it\nfelt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled\nby \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in\ncharge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,\nin much the same way I was converted to \nfatherhood once I had kids.\nWhatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have\nso many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in\nthe meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn't get at the time is that \ngrowth rate is the\nultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about\n70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I\nmistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number\nof users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that\nthat's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough,\nyou might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate\ntakes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was\nadvising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed\nout, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't\nhire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then\nyou'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted\nme to, and partly because that's what startups did during the\nInternet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would\nhave seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about\nwhen Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we\nwere at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.\nAnd since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the\nresult was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb\nstock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable\nand growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had\nno idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of\nthe near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor\nhad I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we\nstarted. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to\nriches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow\n1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were\nby far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must\nhave been th\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\ne least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at\nthe time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running\nViaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue\nmy usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue\ncombined with Yahoo's prematurely aged\nculture and grim cube farm\nin Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it\nfelt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the\ntime I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth\nanything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next\nyear. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the\nsummer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything\nthat I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been\nentirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had\ndone this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now\nI was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation\nwith me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures\nI wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an\ninterest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.\nMy options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I\nwas leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to\ngo and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people\nwith me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was\nground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving\nthen to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,\nand yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.\nThere was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich.\nNow when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their\ncompanies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's\nwhat I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing\nfor a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or\nambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people\nin California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in\nthe Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from\nanywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation\nI went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent\ncontrol you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed\nup like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and\nthere were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't\nknow any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was\nrich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns,\nexcept now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was\ntired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless\nit was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked\npast charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It\nwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented\nwith a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the\nold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and\nthen use that as the underpainting for a \nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\nsecond still life, painted\nfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually\nchoose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and\nvarious real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by\noccasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there\nwasn't one. Huh.Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear\nfrom our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why\nnot build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit\ncode on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting\napplications for them?\n[9]\nYou could run all sorts of services\non the servers that these applications could use just by making an\nAPI call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images,\ntaking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything\nelse. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly\nwant to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would\nhave to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and\nstart it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but\nthere I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and\nthough he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into\nworking on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.\nSo while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly\nrefused to work on it.Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had\nworked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and\nwe got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty\ncompanies and several open source projects worth of software. The\nlanguage for defining applications would of course be a dialect of\nLisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt\nLisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan\ndid.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an\n\"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long\nbefore it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current\nfor long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going\nto be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network\ninfrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two\nservices (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the\nsummer I realized I really didn't want to run a company  especially\nnot a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I'd\nonly started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't\nneed money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be\nrealized as a company, then screw the vision. I'd build a subset\nthat could be done as an open source project.Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not\nwasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often\nencounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and\nit was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and\neven trying to write some of it.The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp,\nwhose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp\nhackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the\ndistinctive features of the l\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\nanguage is that it has dialects, and\npartly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of\nLisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So\nat the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new\ndialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a\ntalk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp\nat Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,\non paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but\nhad never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.\nWhat on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone\nhad posted it on Slashdot.\n[10]Wow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put\nit on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but\nit was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel\nto readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only\nway to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published\nas a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish\nanything.This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people\nhad realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building\nthe infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer\nas well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it\ntook me several years to understand the implications. It meant there\nwould be a whole new generation of \nessays.\n[11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been\nvanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers\nwho went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed\nto publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.\nThere were so many essays that had never been written, because there\nhad been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going\nto write them.\n[12]I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there\nwas a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was\nwhen I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that\nwhatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a \nmarginal medium at first.\nSocially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their\nGeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions\npublished in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to\nfind that encouraging instead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how\nwell it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't\nprestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form\nof painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started\nthem. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what\nI'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish\non my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in\nsomething like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when\nyou find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current\nlack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to\nbe discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.\nImpure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\n anything is\ngoing to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.\nSo while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee\nyou're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the\nmost common type of wrong one.Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds\nof different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a\nbook, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I\nalso worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to\nhave dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which\ntaught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in\nCambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn\nstudio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\ndiners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one\nparty. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be\npeople they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\ncalled Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.\nThis bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,\nas she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised\nhow different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So\nshe decided to compile a book of \ninterviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her\nstaff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed\nfor a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make\nup their minds, and during this time I started telling her about\nall the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They\nshould make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a\nhandful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical\nfounders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as\nCEO, and so on.One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks.\nThe prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people\nand tell them something that won't waste their time is a great\nspur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the\nundergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would\ntell them how to start a startup. Maybe they'd be able to avoid the\nworst of the mistakes we'd made.So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the\nbest sources of seed funding were successful startup founders,\nbecause then they'd be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed\nthey were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect\nof having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known),\nI blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk. But afterward\nit occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about\nangel investing. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now\nit was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects\nwe could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed\nlike there had to be something we could collaborate on.As Jessica and I were walking home fro\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\nm dinner on March 11, at the\ncorner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged.\nScrew the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We'd\nstart our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd\nbeen talking about. I'd fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and\nwork for it, and we'd get Robert and Trevor as partners too.\n[13]Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to\nbe angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways\nto learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices,\nand some of the things we did turned out to be novel.There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn't figure\nthem all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm.\nIn those days, those two words didn't go together. There were VC\nfirms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was\nto make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments.\nAnd there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were\nindividuals who were usually focused on other things and made\ninvestments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough\nin the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects,\nbecause we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing\nJulian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us\nset up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software,\nbut actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all\nthat stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to\nmake seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had\ndone for us.YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we\nfunded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers,\nbut professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got\nall the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular\ninsight on our part. We didn't know how VC firms were organized.\nIt never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we\nwouldn't have known where to start.\n[14]The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a\nbunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three\nmonths focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we\ndiscovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due\nto our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as\ninvestors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch\nof startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech\ncompanies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where\nthey'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being\nin a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense\nbe fake founders. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out\nof it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and\nthey for their part would probably have a more interesting summer\nthan they would working at Microsoft.We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters.\nWe'd all have dinner there once a week  on tuesdays, since I was\nalready cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays  and after\ndinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a\nmatter of days we cooked up something we cal\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nled the Summer Founders\nProgram, and I posted an \nannouncement \non my site, inviting undergrads\nto apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way\nto get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be\nthe perfect source.\n[15]\nWe got 225 applications for the Summer\nFounders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them\nwere from people who'd already graduated, or were about to that\nspring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious\nthan we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and\nfrom those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That\nfirst batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went\non to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the\nRSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access,\nand Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.\nI don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.\nYou had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the\nSummer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place\nlike Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did\nwith Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students\ngot for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the\ntypical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to\nbe fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had\ntaken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought\nthe founders free air conditioners.\n[16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale\nstartup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient\nfor us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups\nat once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too.\nIt solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the\nisolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who\nunderstood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they\nwere solving them.As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The\nalumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another,\nand especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being\nin. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's\ncustomers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YC\ngrows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups\nget their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their\nbatchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going\nto do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew,\nand I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more\nthan a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was\nstill able to work on other things.In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version\nof Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into\nScheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was\noriginally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and\nwas called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of\nreading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders\nwe wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed\nthe name to Hacker News and the topic to \nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\nwhatever engaged one's\nintellectual curiosity.HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest\nsource of stress for me. If all I'd had to do was select and help\nfounders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN\nwas a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work\nshould at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas\nI was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not\nfrom the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an\nill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during\nYC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40%\nchance it had do with everything else combined.\n[17]As well as HN, I wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc. But\nwhile I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped\nworking on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly\nbecause it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language\nnow that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my\nthree projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on\nYC.YC was different from other kinds of work I've done. Instead of\ndeciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every\n6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems,\nwhatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work,\nbecause their problems were quite varied, and the good founders\nwere very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could\nabout startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have\npicked a better way to do it.There were parts of the job I didn't like. Disputes between cofounders,\nfiguring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who\nmaltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the\nparts I didn't like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once\nsaid about companies: \"No one works harder than the boss.\" He meant\nit both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second\npart that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked\nset the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better\nwork very hard.One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews,\nRobert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited\nadvice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at\nViaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested\nthat it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital.\nThat was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I\nremember his exact words very clearly. \"You know,\" he said, \"you\nshould make sure Y Combinator isn't the last cool thing you do.\"At the time I didn't understand what he meant, but gradually it\ndawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange\nadvice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer\nthan Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me\nthinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be\nthe last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my\nattention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of\neating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave\neventually. And it wasn't, so I would.In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned\nout to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The s\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\ntroke destroyed\nher balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really\nwanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I\nwere determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to\nvisit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those\nflights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to\nsomeone else.I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so\nwe decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and\nTrevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard.\nUp till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we\nfour had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to\ndo that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said\nyes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and\nJessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he\nsaid no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors.\nBut I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided\nhe'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest\nof 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could\nlearn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose\ncancer had returned.She died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was\nstill hard when it did.I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups\nthrough Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still\ntalk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested\nin, but that only takes a few hours a week.)What should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about\nthat. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided\nI'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused\non it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting.\nI was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was\nat least completely engaging.\n[18]I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to\nwork so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had\nbeen. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the\nmiddle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd\nalways been curious to see how the painting I was working on would\nturn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So\nI stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted\nsince. So far anyway.I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum\ngame. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project\nthat's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's\ngetting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was\nsome opportunity cost to screwing around.I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over\nthe next few months. I even wrote a couple that \nweren't about\nstartups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language\ndefined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally\nintended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was\nmeant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the\nTuring machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language\nin itself, what's the minimum set of predefin\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\ned operators you need?\nThe Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered,\nis an answer to that question.\n[19]McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program\ncomputers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell\ntranslated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language,\nand from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language\nin the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation\ngave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.\nIt was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand\nwhy at the time.McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions.\nIt was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language.\nSo these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined\nusing McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have\nbeen feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by\nhand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting\nclose to the limit of interpreters you could test that way  indeed,\nthere was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more\ncomplicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers\nthen weren't powerful enough.Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's\naxiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language.\nAnd as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a\ndiscoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle,\nend up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to\ndo than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle,\nwhy not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years,\nfrom March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I\nhad a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep\nat it for so long.I wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, \nin itself in Arc. That may sound\nlike a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery\nI had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious\ncollection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an\ninterpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast,\nbut fast enough to test.I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time,\nor I'd never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing\nessays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely\nunderstand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as\nbecause the problem is so convoluted. When you're working on an\ninterpreter written in itself, it's hard to keep track of what's\nhappening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted\nby the time you get them.So I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people\nabout Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have\nseemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder\nthan I'd ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for\nhours with some gruesome bug I'd check Twitter or HN and see someone\nasking \"Does Paul Graham still code?\"Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively\nthat at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head\nand could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the\ncoast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some\nproblem involving \nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\ncontinuations while I watched them play in the\ntide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that\nbecause I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news\nis that I had more moments like this over the next few years.In the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to\nsee what it was like living in another country, and since I was a\nBritish citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only\nmeant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still\nlive there. So most of Bel was written in England.In the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's\noriginal Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although\nlike McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics\nI'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also\nstarted to think about other things I could work on. How should I\nchoose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the\npast? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I\nwas surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If\nthis surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would\nbe interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with\nsimilarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others\nto read, and this is the last sentence of it.\nNotes[1]\nMy experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers:\ntime-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from\nbatch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem\nall the more exciting.[2]\nItalian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be\npredicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps\nlike polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you\nstring together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs,\nyou can make a little Italian go a long way.[3]\nI lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia\nwent straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across\nthe bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery,\nand then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at\nstreet level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter\nevenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with\ntourists.[4]\nYou can of course paint people like still lives if you want\nto, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex\nof still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce\npained expressions in the sitters.[5]\nInterleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and\nbuilt impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law.\nIn the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e.\nIntel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and\nsoftware companies like a bulldozer.[6]\nThe signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically\nmercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled.\nAnything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as\ncool will soon become equally expensive.[7]\nTechnically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but\nrent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would\nknow or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less\nthan half market price.[8]\nMost software you can launch as soon as it's d\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\none. But when\nthe software is an online store builder and you're hosting the\nstores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully\nobvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch\nprivately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and\nmaking sure they had decent-looking stores.[9]\nWe'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their\nown page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp\nexpressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the\ncode ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers\nvisited them.[10]\nThis was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience,\nand so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found\nthey were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was\nbetter than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete?\nPeople who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me\nhow sorry they feel for me, but I'm not exaggerating when I reply\nthat it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It\ncomes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they\ndon't already know, and some \npeople dislike being told such things.[11]\nPeople put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of\ncourse, but putting something online is not the same as publishing\nit online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as\nthe (or at least a) primary version.[12]\nThere is a general lesson here that our experience with Y\nCombinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long\nafter the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary\nVC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays,\nbeen based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more\nexpensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap\nand common, but the VCs' customs still reflected the old world,\njust as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints\nof the print era.Which in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e.\nless influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected\nby rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).Here's an interesting point, though: you can't always predict which\nfields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and\nventure capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay\nwriting would be?[13]\nY Combinator was not the original name. At first we were\ncalled Cambridge Seed. But we didn't want a regional name, in case\nsomeone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after\none of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.I picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and\npartly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors\nlike maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying\nto appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside\njoke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made\nthe YC logo a white Y on an orange square.[14]\nYC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009,\nbecause it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it\npersonally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go\nback to being self-funded.[15]\nI've never liked the term \"deal flow,\" because it implies\nthat the number of new startups at any given t\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\nime is fixed. This\nis not only false, but it's the purpose of YC to falsify it, by\ncausing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.[16]\nShe reports that they were all different shapes and sizes,\nbecause there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get\nwhatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could\ncarry now.[17]\nAnother problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs\nwhen you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum,\nyou're assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every\nconversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post\nhighly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually\nthese two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination\nis disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations,\nbecause the assumption that you're present in the conversation means\nthat not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation\nreads as a tacit admission that it's correct. But that in turn\nenco\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely bec\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\nause of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if \nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\nthe founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be desig\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\nned to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actua\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nl goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\n software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax,\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\n any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to \nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\nbe the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to \nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\nget found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of H\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\nilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories we\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nre awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\n in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\no\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\nf my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthes\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\nis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\n all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Mi\nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\ncrosoft Word?\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\nBetter organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the\npainting department. The textile depa\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\nrtment, which my next door\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\nPainting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\nof dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\nbest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\ndefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A\nrent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\nUpper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\nNow I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\ndays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers\nof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't\nthat much older than me, and was super rich. The t\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\nhought suddenly\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work\non whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called\nthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited\nhim in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It\nseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical\nuser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.\nI was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\nwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art\ngalleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy\nones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate\nweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and\nset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up\ngalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.\nIt was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites\nfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that\nexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd\nbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called\nan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy\nof ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write\nsoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to be\nnormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.\nThat was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to\nwrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix\nworld. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new\nsite generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate\nwas away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his\nroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a\nmattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress\nI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran\nthe software on the server, and let users control it by clicking\non links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve\nthem from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at\nthe time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,\nwe decided to try making a version of our store builder that you\ncould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August\n12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you\ncould build a whole store through the browser, without any client\nsoftware or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a\nwhole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't\nneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there\nhad been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to\nbe at least as big as the group that actually wrote\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\n the software.\nNow you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our\nsoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding\nfrom Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the\ninitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%\nof the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y\nCombinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because\nwe'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand\ndollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by\nwhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside\nthe proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?\nNo, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,\nI needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious\nabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to\nbuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating\npages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be\ngenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,\nthe links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the\nserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online\nstore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking\nlegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts\nand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his\nbedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because\nit's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but\nin 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a\nmonth,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in\nretrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years\nlater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,\nand I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.\nHe recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because\nat that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything\nin his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with\nhim. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a\nfrighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two\nmost independent-minded people \nI know, and in completely different\nways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a\ncolonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's\nit would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just\nas well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were\nlate, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of\ntalk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually\nwanted online stores.\n[8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which\npeople used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,\nwhich Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and\nstatistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one\nof the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight\nand didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's\nand Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do\nwas work on this\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\n software, the next 3 years would have been the\neasiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of\nit stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were\ninstead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second\nhalf of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not\nthe Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It\nwas lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make\nViaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a\nmonth for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low\nprice was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of\ncompetitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we\nset the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.\n$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,\nwe did what's now called \"doing things that \ndon't scale,\" although\nat the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're\ndriven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common\nof which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly\nhumiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that\npeople could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get\nusers.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For\nexample, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt\n(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better\nto have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.\nThe reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to\nrescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were\nso beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.\nBuilding stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it\nfelt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled\nby \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in\ncharge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,\nin much the same way I was converted to \nfatherhood once I had kids.\nWhatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have\nso many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in\nthe meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn't get at the time is that \ngrowth rate is the\nultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about\n70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I\nmistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number\nof users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that\nthat's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough,\nyou might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate\ntakes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was\nadvising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed\nout, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't\nhire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then\nyou'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted\nme to, and partly because that's what startups did during the\nInternet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would\nhave seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about\nwhen Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we\nwere at the mercy of investors for the entire life o\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\nf the company.\nAnd since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the\nresult was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb\nstock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable\nand growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had\nno idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of\nthe near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor\nhad I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we\nstarted. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to\nriches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow\n1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were\nby far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must\nhave been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at\nthe time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running\nViaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue\nmy usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue\ncombined with Yahoo's prematurely aged\nculture and grim cube farm\nin Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it\nfelt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the\ntime I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth\nanything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next\nyear. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the\nsummer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything\nthat I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been\nentirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had\ndone this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now\nI was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation\nwith me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures\nI wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an\ninterest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.\nMy options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I\nwas leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to\ngo and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people\nwith me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was\nground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving\nthen to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,\nand yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.\nThere was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich.\nNow when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their\ncompanies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's\nwhat I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing\nfor a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or\nambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people\nin California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in\nthe Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from\nanywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation\nI went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent\ncontrol you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed\nup like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and\nthere were other\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\n people trying to paint there, even though I didn't\nknow any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was\nrich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns,\nexcept now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was\ntired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless\nit was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked\npast charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It\nwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented\nwith a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the\nold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and\nthen use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted\nfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually\nchoose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and\nvarious real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by\noccasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there\nwasn't one. Huh.Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear\nfrom our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why\nnot build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit\ncode on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting\napplications for them?\n[9]\nYou could run all sorts of services\non the servers that these applications could use just by making an\nAPI call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images,\ntaking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything\nelse. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly\nwant to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would\nhave to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and\nstart it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but\nthere I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and\nthough he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into\nworking on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.\nSo while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly\nrefused to work on it.Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had\nworked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and\nwe got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty\ncompanies and several open source projects worth of software. The\nlanguage for defining applications would of course be a dialect of\nLisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt\nLisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan\ndid.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an\n\"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long\nbefore it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current\nfor long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going\nto be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network\ninfrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two\nservices (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the\nsummer I realized I really didn't want to run a company  especially\nnot a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I'd\nonly started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't\nneed money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be\nrealized as a company, then screw the visio\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\nn. I'd build a subset\nthat could be done as an open source project.Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not\nwasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often\nencounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and\nit was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and\neven trying to write some of it.The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp,\nwhose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp\nhackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the\ndistinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and\npartly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of\nLisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So\nat the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new\ndialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a\ntalk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp\nat Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,\non paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but\nhad never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.\nWhat on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone\nhad posted it on Slashdot.\n[10]Wow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put\nit on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but\nit was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel\nto readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only\nway to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published\nas a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish\nanything.This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people\nhad realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building\nthe infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer\nas well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it\ntook me several years to understand the implications. It meant there\nwould be a whole new generation of \nessays.\n[11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been\nvanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers\nwho went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed\nto publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.\nThere were so many essays that had never been written, because there\nhad been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going\nto write them.\n[12]I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there\nwas a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was\nwhen I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that\nwhatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a \nmarginal medium at first.\nSocially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their\nGeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions\npublished in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to\nfind that encouraging instead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how\nwell it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't\nprestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form\nof painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started\nthem. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what\nI'm writing, and I explain that it's an\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\n essay I'm going to publish\non my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in\nsomething like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when\nyou find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current\nlack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to\nbe discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.\nImpure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is\ngoing to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.\nSo while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee\nyou're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the\nmost common type of wrong one.Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds\nof different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a\nbook, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I\nalso worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to\nhave dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which\ntaught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in\nCambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn\nstudio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\ndiners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one\nparty. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be\npeople they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\ncalled Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.\nThis bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,\nas she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised\nhow different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So\nshe decided to compile a book of \ninterviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her\nstaff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed\nfor a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make\nup their minds, and during this time I started telling her about\nall the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They\nshould make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a\nhandful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical\nfounders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as\nCEO, and so on.One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks.\nThe prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people\nand tell them something that won't waste their time is a great\nspur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the\nundergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would\ntell them how to start a startup. Maybe they'd be able to avoid the\nworst of the mistakes we'd made.So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the\nbest sources of seed funding were successful startup founders,\nbecause then they'd be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed\nthey were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect\nof having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known),\nI blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk. But afterward\nit occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about\nangel investing. I'd b\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\neen meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now\nit was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects\nwe could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed\nlike there had to be something we could collaborate on.As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the\ncorner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged.\nScrew the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We'd\nstart our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd\nbeen talking about. I'd fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and\nwork for it, and we'd get Robert and Trevor as partners too.\n[13]Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to\nbe angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways\nto learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices,\nand some of the things we did turned out to be novel.There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn't figure\nthem all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm.\nIn those days, those two words didn't go together. There were VC\nfirms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was\nto make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments.\nAnd there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were\nindividuals who were usually focused on other things and made\ninvestments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough\nin the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects,\nbecause we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing\nJulian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us\nset up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software,\nbut actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all\nthat stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to\nmake seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had\ndone for us.YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we\nfunded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers,\nbut professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got\nall the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular\ninsight on our part. We didn't know how VC firms were organized.\nIt never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we\nwouldn't have known where to start.\n[14]The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a\nbunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three\nmonths focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we\ndiscovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due\nto our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as\ninvestors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch\nof startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech\ncompanies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where\nthey'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being\nin a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense\nbe fake founders. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out\nof it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and\nthey for their part would probably have a more interesting summer\nthan they would working at Microsoft.We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters.\nWe'd all have dinner there once a week  on tuesdays, since I was\nalready cook\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\ning for the thursday diners on thursdays  and after\ndinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a\nmatter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders\nProgram, and I posted an \nannouncement \non my site, inviting undergrads\nto apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way\nto get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be\nthe perfect source.\n[15]\nWe got 225 applications for the Summer\nFounders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them\nwere from people who'd already graduated, or were about to that\nspring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious\nthan we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and\nfrom those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That\nfirst batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went\non to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the\nRSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access,\nand Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.\nI don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.\nYou had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the\nSummer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place\nlike Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did\nwith Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students\ngot for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the\ntypical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to\nbe fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had\ntaken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought\nthe founders free air conditioners.\n[16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale\nstartup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient\nfor us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups\nat once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too.\nIt solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the\nisolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who\nunderstood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they\nwere solving them.As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The\nalumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another,\nand especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being\nin. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's\ncustomers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YC\ngrows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups\nget their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their\nbatchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going\nto do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew,\nand I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more\nthan a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was\nstill able to work on other things.In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version\nof Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into\nScheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was\noriginally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and\nwas called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of\nreading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders\nwe wanted to re\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nach. It was future startup founders. So I changed\nthe name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's\nintellectual curiosity.HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest\nsource of stress for me. If all I'd had to do was select and help\nfounders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN\nwas a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work\nshould at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas\nI was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not\nfrom the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an\nill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during\nYC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40%\nchance it had do with everything else combined.\n[17]As well as HN, I wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc. But\nwhile I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped\nworking on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly\nbecause it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language\nnow that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my\nthree projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on\nYC.YC was different from other kinds of work I've done. Instead of\ndeciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every\n6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems,\nwhatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work,\nbecause their problems were quite varied, and the good founders\nwere very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could\nabout startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have\npicked a better way to do it.There were parts of the job I didn't like. Disputes between cofounders,\nfiguring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who\nmaltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the\nparts I didn't like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once\nsaid about companies: \"No one works harder than the boss.\" He meant\nit both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second\npart that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked\nset the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better\nwork very hard.One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews,\nRobert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited\nadvice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at\nViaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested\nthat it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital.\nThat was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I\nremember his exact words very clearly. \"You know,\" he said, \"you\nshould make sure Y Combinator isn't the last cool thing you do.\"At the time I didn't understand what he meant, but gradually it\ndawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange\nadvice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer\nthan Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me\nthinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be\nthe last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my\nattention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of\neating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave\neventually. And it wasn't, so I would.In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned\nout to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed\nher balance, and s\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\nhe was put in a nursing home, but she really\nwanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I\nwere determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to\nvisit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those\nflights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to\nsomeone else.I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so\nwe decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and\nTrevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard.\nUp till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we\nfour had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to\ndo that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said\nyes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and\nJessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he\nsaid no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors.\nBut I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided\nhe'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest\nof 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could\nlearn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose\ncancer had returned.She died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was\nstill hard when it did.I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups\nthrough Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still\ntalk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested\nin, but that only takes a few hours a week.)What should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about\nthat. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided\nI'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused\non it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting.\nI was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was\nat least completely engaging.\n[18]I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to\nwork so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had\nbeen. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the\nmiddle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd\nalways been curious to see how the painting I was working on would\nturn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So\nI stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted\nsince. So far anyway.I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum\ngame. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project\nthat's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's\ngetting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was\nsome opportunity cost to screwing around.I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over\nthe next few months. I even wrote a couple that \nweren't about\nstartups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language\ndefined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally\nintended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was\nmeant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the\nTuring machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language\nin itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need?\nThe Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered,\nis an answer to that question.\n[19]McCarthy didn't realize this Lis\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\np could even be used to program\ncomputers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell\ntranslated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language,\nand from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language\nin the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation\ngave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.\nIt was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand\nwhy at the time.McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions.\nIt was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language.\nSo these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined\nusing McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have\nbeen feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by\nhand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting\nclose to the limit of interpreters you could test that way  indeed,\nthere was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more\ncomplicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers\nthen weren't powerful enough.Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's\naxiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language.\nAnd as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a\ndiscoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle,\nend up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to\ndo than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle,\nwhy not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years,\nfrom March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I\nhad a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep\nat it for so long.I wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, \nin itself in Arc. That may sound\nlike a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery\nI had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious\ncollection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an\ninterpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast,\nbut fast enough to test.I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time,\nor I'd never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing\nessays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely\nunderstand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as\nbecause the problem is so convoluted. When you're working on an\ninterpreter written in itself, it's hard to keep track of what's\nhappening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted\nby the time you get them.So I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people\nabout Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have\nseemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder\nthan I'd ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for\nhours with some gruesome bug I'd check Twitter or HN and see someone\nasking \"Does Paul Graham still code?\"Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively\nthat at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head\nand could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the\ncoast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some\nproblem involving continuations while I watched them play in the\ntide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that\nbecause I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news\nis that I had more moments like this over the next few years.In the summer of 2016 we moved to England. \nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\nWe wanted our kids to\nsee what it was like living in another country, and since I was a\nBritish citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only\nmeant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still\nlive there. So most of Bel was written in England.In the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's\noriginal Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although\nlike McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics\nI'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also\nstarted to think about other things I could work on. How should I\nchoose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the\npast? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I\nwas surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If\nthis surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would\nbe interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with\nsimilarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others\nto read, and this is the last sentence of it.\nNotes[1]\nMy experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers:\ntime-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from\nbatch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem\nall the more exciting.[2]\nItalian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be\npredicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps\nlike polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you\nstring together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs,\nyou can make a little Italian go a long way.[3]\nI lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia\nwent straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across\nthe bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery,\nand then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at\nstreet level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter\nevenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with\ntourists.[4]\nYou can of course paint people like still lives if you want\nto, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex\nof still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce\npained expressions in the sitters.[5]\nInterleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and\nbuilt impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law.\nIn the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e.\nIntel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and\nsoftware companies like a bulldozer.[6]\nThe signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically\nmercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled.\nAnything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as\ncool will soon become equally expensive.[7]\nTechnically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but\nrent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would\nknow or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less\nthan half market price.[8]\nMost software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when\nthe software is an online store builder and you're hosting the\nstores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully\nobvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch\nprivately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and\nmaking sure they had decent-looking stores.[9]\nWe'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their\nown page styles. They didn't k\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\nnow it, but they were editing Lisp\nexpressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the\ncode ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers\nvisited them.[10]\nThis was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience,\nand so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found\nthey were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was\nbetter than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete?\nPeople who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me\nhow sorry they feel for me, but I'm not exaggerating when I reply\nthat it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It\ncomes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they\ndon't already know, and some \npeople dislike being told such things.[11]\nPeople put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of\ncourse, but putting something online is not the same as publishing\nit online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as\nthe (or at least a) primary version.[12]\nThere is a general lesson here that our experience with Y\nCombinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long\nafter the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary\nVC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays,\nbeen based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more\nexpensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap\nand common, but the VCs' customs still reflected the old world,\njust as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints\nof the print era.Which in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e.\nless influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected\nby rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).Here's an interesting point, though: you can't always predict which\nfields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and\nventure capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay\nwriting would be?[13]\nY Combinator was not the original name. At first we were\ncalled Cambridge Seed. But we didn't want a regional name, in case\nsomeone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after\none of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.I picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and\npartly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors\nlike maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying\nto appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside\njoke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made\nthe YC logo a white Y on an orange square.[14]\nYC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009,\nbecause it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it\npersonally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go\nback to being self-funded.[15]\nI've never liked the term \"deal flow,\" because it implies\nthat the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This\nis not only false, but it's the purpose of YC to falsify it, by\ncausing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.[16]\nShe reports that they were all different shapes and sizes,\nbecause there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get\nwhatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could\ncarry now.[17]\nAnother problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs\nwhen you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum,\nyou're assumed to see if not every conversation,\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\n at least every\nconversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post\nhighly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually\nthese two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination\nis disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations,\nbecause the assumption that you're present in the conversation means\nthat not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation\nreads as a tacit admission that it's correct. But that in turn\nencourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses\nthat now is their chance.[18]\nThe worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica\nanymore. We'd been working on YC almost the whole time we'd known\neach other, and we'd neither tried nor wanted to separate it from\nour personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted\ntree.[19]\nOne way to get more precise about the concept of invented vs\ndiscovered is to talk about space aliens. Any sufficiently advanced\nalien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean\ntheorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty, that\nthey would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy's 1960 paper.But if so there's no reason to suppose that this is the limit of\nthe language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need\nnumbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at\nleast one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness\nis preserved.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel\nGackle, Ralph Hazell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj\nTaggar for reading drafts of this.December 2014If the world were static, we could have monotonically increasing\nconfidence in our beliefs.  The more (and more varied) experience\na belief survived, the less likely it would be false.  Most people\nimplicitly believe something like this about their opinions.  And\nthey're justified in doing so with opinions about things that don't\nchange much, like human nature.  But you can't trust your opinions\nin the same way about things that change, which could include\npractically everything else.When experts are wrong, it's often because they're experts on an\nearlier version of the world.Is it possible to avoid that?  Can you protect yourself against\nobsolete beliefs?  To some extent, yes. I spent almost a decade\ninvesting in early stage startups, and curiously enough protecting\nyourself against obsolete beliefs is exactly what you have to do\nto succeed as a startup investor.  Most really good startup ideas\nlook like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad specifically\nbecause some change in the world just switched them from bad to\ngood.  I spent a lot of time learning to recognize such ideas, and\nthe techniques I used may be applicable to ideas in general.The first step is to have an explicit belief in change.  People who\nfall victim to a monotonically increasing confidence in their\nopinions are implicitly concluding the world is static.  If you\nconsciously remind yourself it isn't, you start to look for change.Where should one look for it?  Beyond the moderately useful\ngeneralization that human nature doesn't change much, the unfortunate\nfact is that change is hard to predict.  This is largely a tautology\nbut worth remembering all the same: change that matters usually\ncomes from an unforeseen quarter.So I don't even try to predict it.  When I get asked in interviews\nto predict the future, I always have to str\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\nuggle to come up with\nsomething plausible-sounding on the fly, like a student who hasn't\nprepared for an exam.\n[1]\nBut it's not out of laziness that I haven't\nprepared.  It seems to me that beliefs about the future are so\nrarely correct that they usually aren't worth the extra rigidity\nthey impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively\nopen-minded.  Instead of trying to point yourself in the right\ndirection, admit you have no idea what the right direction is, and\ntry instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change.It's ok to have working hypotheses, even though they may constrain\nyou a bit, because they also motivate you.  It's exciting to chase\nthings and exciting to try to guess answers.  But you have to be\ndisciplined about not letting your hypotheses harden into anything\nmore.\n[2]I believe this passive m.o. works not just for evaluating new ideas\nbut also for having them.  The way to come up with new ideas is not\nto try explicitly to, but to try to solve problems and simply not\ndiscou\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\n\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things cu\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\nrrently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\nIf you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some ide\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\na you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windo\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\nws\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sha\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\nring.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people desi\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\ngn\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors ab\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\nout how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\n you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, \nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nbut I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I \nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nwas going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; \nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\nwhat was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\n as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly \nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\nemphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplanned meetings ar\nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\ne inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\nBetter organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\nPainting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\nof dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\nbest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\ndefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A\nrent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\nUpper \nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\nEast Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\nNow I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\ndays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers\nof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't\nthat much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work\non whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called\nthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited\nhim in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It\nseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical\nuser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.\nI was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\nwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art\ngalleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy\nones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate\nweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and\nset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up\ngalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.\nIt was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites\nfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that\nexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd\nbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called\nan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy\nof ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write\nsoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to be\nnormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.\nThat was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to\nwrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix\nworld. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new\nsite generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\n Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate\nwas away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his\nroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a\nmattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress\nI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran\nthe software on the server, and let users control it by clicking\non links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve\nthem from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at\nthe time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,\nwe decided to try making a version of our store builder that you\ncould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August\n12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you\ncould build a whole store through the browser, without any client\nsoftware or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a\nwhole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't\nneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there\nhad been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to\nbe at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.\nNow you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our\nsoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding\nfrom Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the\ninitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%\nof the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y\nCombinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because\nwe'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand\ndollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by\nwhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside\nthe proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?\nNo, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,\nI needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious\nabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to\nbuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating\npages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be\ngenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,\nthe links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the\nserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online\nstore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking\nlegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts\nand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his\nbedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because\nit's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but\nin 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a\nmonth,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in\nretrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years\nlater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,\nand I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.\nHe recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because\nat that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything\nin his life to a stack of notecards, \nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\nwhich he carried around with\nhim. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a\nfrighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two\nmost independent-minded people \nI know, and in completely different\nways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a\ncolonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's\nit would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just\nas well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were\nlate, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of\ntalk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually\nwanted online stores.\n[8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which\npeople used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,\nwhich Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and\nstatistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one\nof the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight\nand didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's\nand Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do\nwas work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the\neasiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of\nit stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were\ninstead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second\nhalf of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not\nthe Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It\nwas lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make\nViaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a\nmonth for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low\nprice was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of\ncompetitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we\nset the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.\n$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,\nwe did what's now called \"doing things that \ndon't scale,\" although\nat the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're\ndriven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common\nof which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly\nhumiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that\npeople could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get\nusers.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For\nexample, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt\n(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better\nto have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.\nThe reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to\nrescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were\nso beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.\nBuilding stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it\nfelt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled\nby \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in\ncharge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,\nin much the same way I was converted to \nfatherhood once I had kids.\nWhatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have\nso many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in\nthe meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn't get at the time is that \ngrow\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\nth rate is the\nultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about\n70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I\nmistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number\nof users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that\nthat's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough,\nyou might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate\ntakes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was\nadvising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed\nout, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't\nhire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then\nyou'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted\nme to, and partly because that's what startups did during the\nInternet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would\nhave seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about\nwhen Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we\nwere at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.\nAnd since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the\nresult was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb\nstock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable\nand growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had\nno idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of\nthe near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor\nhad I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we\nstarted. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to\nriches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow\n1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were\nby far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must\nhave been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at\nthe time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running\nViaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue\nmy usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue\ncombined with Yahoo's prematurely aged\nculture and grim cube farm\nin Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it\nfelt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the\ntime I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth\nanything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next\nyear. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the\nsummer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything\nthat I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been\nentirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had\ndone this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now\nI was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation\nwith me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures\nI wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an\ninterest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.\nMy options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I\nwas leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to\ngo and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people\nwith me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was\nground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving\nthen to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\n,\nand yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.\nThere was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich.\nNow when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their\ncompanies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's\nwhat I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing\nfor a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or\nambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people\nin California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in\nthe Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from\nanywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation\nI went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent\ncontrol you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed\nup like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and\nthere were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't\nknow any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was\nrich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns,\nexcept now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was\ntired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless\nit was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked\npast charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It\nwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented\nwith a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the\nold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and\nthen use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted\nfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually\nchoose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and\nvarious real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by\noccasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there\nwasn't one. Huh.Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear\nfrom our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why\nnot build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit\ncode on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting\napplications for them?\n[9]\nYou could run all sorts of services\non the servers that these applications could use just by making an\nAPI call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images,\ntaking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything\nelse. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly\nwant to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would\nhave to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and\nstart it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but\nthere I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and\nthough he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into\nworking on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.\nSo while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly\nrefused to work on it.Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had\nworked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and\nwe got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty\ncompanies and several open source projects worth of software. The\nlanguage for defining applications would of course be a dialect of\nLisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt\nLisp on a general audience\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\n; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan\ndid.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an\n\"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long\nbefore it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current\nfor long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going\nto be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network\ninfrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two\nservices (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the\nsummer I realized I really didn't want to run a company  especially\nnot a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I'd\nonly started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't\nneed money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be\nrealized as a company, then screw the vision. I'd build a subset\nthat could be done as an open source project.Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not\nwasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often\nencounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and\nit was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and\neven trying to write some of it.The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp,\nwhose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp\nhackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the\ndistinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and\npartly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of\nLisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So\nat the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new\ndialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a\ntalk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp\nat Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,\non paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but\nhad never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.\nWhat on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone\nhad posted it on Slashdot.\n[10]Wow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put\nit on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but\nit was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel\nto readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only\nway to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published\nas a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish\nanything.This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people\nhad realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building\nthe infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer\nas well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it\ntook me several years to understand the implications. It meant there\nwould be a whole new generation of \nessays.\n[11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been\nvanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers\nwho went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed\nto publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.\nThere were so many essays that had never been written, because there\nhad been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going\nto write them.\n[12]I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there\nwas a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was\nwhen I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that\nwhatever else I did\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\n, I'd always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a \nmarginal medium at first.\nSocially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their\nGeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions\npublished in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to\nfind that encouraging instead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how\nwell it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't\nprestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form\nof painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started\nthem. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what\nI'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish\non my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in\nsomething like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when\nyou find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current\nlack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to\nbe discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.\nImpure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is\ngoing to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.\nSo while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee\nyou're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the\nmost common type of wrong one.Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds\nof different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a\nbook, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I\nalso worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to\nhave dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which\ntaught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in\nCambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn\nstudio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\ndiners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one\nparty. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be\npeople they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\ncalled Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.\nThis bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,\nas she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised\nhow different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So\nshe decided to compile a book of \ninterviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her\nstaff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed\nfor a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make\nup their minds, and during this time I started telling her about\nall the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They\nshould make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a\nhandful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical\nfounders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as\nCEO, and so on.One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks.\nThe prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people\nand tell them something that won't waste their time is a great\nspur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the\nundergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided \nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\nI would\ntell them how to start a startup. Maybe they'd be able to avoid the\nworst of the mistakes we'd made.So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the\nbest sources of seed funding were successful startup founders,\nbecause then they'd be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed\nthey were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect\nof having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known),\nI blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk. But afterward\nit occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about\nangel investing. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now\nit was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects\nwe could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed\nlike there had to be something we could collaborate on.As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the\ncorner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged.\nScrew the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We'd\nstart our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd\nbeen talking about. I'd fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and\nwork for it, and we'd get Robert and Trevor as partners too.\n[13]Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to\nbe angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways\nto learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices,\nand some of the things we did turned out to be novel.There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn't figure\nthem all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm.\nIn those days, those two words didn't go together. There were VC\nfirms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was\nto make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments.\nAnd there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were\nindividuals who were usually focused on other things and made\ninvestments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough\nin the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects,\nbecause we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing\nJulian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us\nset up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software,\nbut actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all\nthat stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to\nmake seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had\ndone for us.YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we\nfunded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers,\nbut professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got\nall the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular\ninsight on our part. We didn't know how VC firms were organized.\nIt never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we\nwouldn't have known where to start.\n[14]The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a\nbunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three\nmonths focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we\ndiscovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due\nto our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as\ninvestors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch\nof startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech\ncompanies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where\nthey'd start startups instead? We wouldn't\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\n feel guilty for being\nin a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense\nbe fake founders. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out\nof it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and\nthey for their part would probably have a more interesting summer\nthan they would working at Microsoft.We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters.\nWe'd all have dinner there once a week  on tuesdays, since I was\nalready cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays  and after\ndinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a\nmatter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders\nProgram, and I posted an \nannouncement \non my site, inviting undergrads\nto apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way\nto get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be\nthe perfect source.\n[15]\nWe got 225 applications for the Summer\nFounders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them\nwere from people who'd already graduated, or were about to that\nspring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious\nthan we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and\nfrom those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That\nfirst batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went\non to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the\nRSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access,\nand Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.\nI don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.\nYou had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the\nSummer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place\nlike Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did\nwith Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students\ngot for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the\ntypical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to\nbe fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had\ntaken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought\nthe founders free air conditioners.\n[16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale\nstartup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient\nfor us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups\nat once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too.\nIt solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the\nisolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who\nunderstood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they\nwere solving them.As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The\nalumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another,\nand especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being\nin. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's\ncustomers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YC\ngrows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups\nget their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their\nbatchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going\nto do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew,\nand I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more\nthan a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was\nstill able to work on other things.In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version\no\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\nf Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into\nScheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was\noriginally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and\nwas called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of\nreading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders\nwe wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed\nthe name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's\nintellectual curiosity.HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest\nsource of stress for me. If all I'd had to do was select and help\nfounders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN\nwas a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work\nshould at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas\nI was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not\nfrom the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an\nill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during\nYC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40%\nchance it had do with everything else combined.\n[17]As well as HN, I wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc. But\nwhile I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped\nworking on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly\nbecause it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language\nnow that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my\nthree projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on\nYC.YC was different from other kinds of work I've done. Instead of\ndeciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every\n6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems,\nwhatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work,\nbecause their problems were quite varied, and the good founders\nwere very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could\nabout startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have\npicked a better way to do it.There were parts of the job I didn't like. Disputes between cofounders,\nfiguring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who\nmaltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the\nparts I didn't like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once\nsaid about companies: \"No one works harder than the boss.\" He meant\nit both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second\npart that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked\nset the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better\nwork very hard.One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews,\nRobert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited\nadvice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at\nViaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested\nthat it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital.\nThat was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I\nremember his exact words very clearly. \"You know,\" he said, \"you\nshould make sure Y Combinator isn't the last cool thing you do.\"At the time I didn't understand what he meant, but gradually it\ndawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange\nadvice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer\nthan Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me\nthinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be\nthe last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my\nattention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of\neating essays too. Either YC was my life's w\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nork or I'd have to leave\neventually. And it wasn't, so I would.In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned\nout to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed\nher balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really\nwanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I\nwere determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to\nvisit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those\nflights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to\nsomeone else.I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so\nwe decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and\nTrevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard.\nUp till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we\nfour had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to\ndo that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said\nyes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and\nJessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he\nsaid no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors.\nBut I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided\nhe'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest\nof 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could\nlearn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose\ncancer had returned.She died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was\nstill hard when it did.I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups\nthrough Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still\ntalk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested\nin, but that only takes a few hours a week.)What should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about\nthat. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided\nI'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused\non it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting.\nI was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was\nat least completely engaging.\n[18]I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to\nwork so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had\nbeen. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the\nmiddle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd\nalways been curious to see how the painting I was working on would\nturn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So\nI stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted\nsince. So far anyway.I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum\ngame. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project\nthat's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's\ngetting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was\nsome opportunity cost to screwing around.I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over\nthe next few months. I even wrote a couple that \nweren't about\nstartups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language\ndefined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally\nintended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was\nmeant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the\nTuring machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language\nin itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need?\nThe Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\n accurately discovered,\nis an answer to that question.\n[19]McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program\ncomputers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell\ntranslated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language,\nand from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language\nin the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation\ngave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.\nIt was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand\nwhy at the time.McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions.\nIt was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language.\nSo these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined\nusing McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have\nbeen feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by\nhand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting\nclose to the limit of interpreters you could test that way  indeed,\nthere was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more\ncomplicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers\nthen weren't powerful enough.Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's\naxiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language.\nAnd as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a\ndiscoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle,\nend up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to\ndo than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle,\nwhy not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years,\nfrom March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I\nhad a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep\nat it for so long.I wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, \nin itself in Arc. That may sound\nlike a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery\nI had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious\ncollection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an\ninterpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast,\nbut fast enough to test.I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time,\nor I'd never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing\nessays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely\nunderstand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as\nbecause the problem is so convoluted. When you're working on an\ninterpreter written in itself, it's hard to keep track of what's\nhappening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted\nby the time you get them.So I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people\nabout Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have\nseemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder\nthan I'd ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for\nhours with some gruesome bug I'd check Twitter or HN and see someone\nasking \"Does Paul Graham still code?\"Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively\nthat at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head\nand could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the\ncoast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some\nproblem involving continuations while I watched them play in the\ntide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that\nbecause I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news\nis that I had more moments like this over the next few years.In the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to\nsee what it \nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\nwas like living in another country, and since I was a\nBritish citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only\nmeant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still\nlive there. So most of Bel was written in England.In the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's\noriginal Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although\nlike McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics\nI'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also\nstarted to think about other things I could work on. How should I\nchoose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the\npast? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I\nwas surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If\nthis surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would\nbe interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with\nsimilarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others\nto read, and this is the last sentence of it.\nNotes[1]\nMy experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers:\ntime-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from\nbatch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem\nall the more exciting.[2]\nItalian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be\npredicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps\nlike polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you\nstring together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs,\nyou can make a little Italian go a long way.[3]\nI lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia\nwent straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across\nthe bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery,\nand then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at\nstreet level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter\nevenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with\ntourists.[4]\nYou can of course paint people like still lives if you want\nto, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex\nof still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce\npained expressions in the sitters.[5]\nInterleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and\nbuilt impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law.\nIn the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e.\nIntel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and\nsoftware companies like a bulldozer.[6]\nThe signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically\nmercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled.\nAnything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as\ncool will soon become equally expensive.[7]\nTechnically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but\nrent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would\nknow or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less\nthan half market price.[8]\nMost software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when\nthe software is an online store builder and you're hosting the\nstores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully\nobvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch\nprivately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and\nmaking sure they had decent-looking stores.[9]\nWe'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their\nown page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp\nexpressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the\ncode ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not wh\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\nen shoppers\nvisited them.[10]\nThis was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience,\nand so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found\nthey were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was\nbetter than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete?\nPeople who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me\nhow sorry they feel for me, but I'm not exaggerating when I reply\nthat it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It\ncomes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they\ndon't already know, and some \npeople dislike being told such things.[11]\nPeople put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of\ncourse, but putting something online is not the same as publishing\nit online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as\nthe (or at least a) primary version.[12]\nThere is a general lesson here that our experience with Y\nCombinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long\nafter the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary\nVC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays,\nbeen based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more\nexpensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap\nand common, but the VCs' customs still reflected the old world,\njust as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints\nof the print era.Which in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e.\nless influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected\nby rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).Here's an interesting point, though: you can't always predict which\nfields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and\nventure capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay\nwriting would be?[13]\nY Combinator was not the original name. At first we were\ncalled Cambridge Seed. But we didn't want a regional name, in case\nsomeone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after\none of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.I picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and\npartly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors\nlike maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying\nto appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside\njoke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made\nthe YC logo a white Y on an orange square.[14]\nYC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009,\nbecause it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it\npersonally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go\nback to being self-funded.[15]\nI've never liked the term \"deal flow,\" because it implies\nthat the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This\nis not only false, but it's the purpose of YC to falsify it, by\ncausing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.[16]\nShe reports that they were all different shapes and sizes,\nbecause there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get\nwhatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could\ncarry now.[17]\nAnother problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs\nwhen you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum,\nyou're assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every\nconversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post\nhighly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually\nthese two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination\nis disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretat\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\nions,\nbecause the assumption that you're present in the conversation means\nthat not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation\nreads as a tacit admission that it's correct. But that in turn\nencourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses\nthat now is their chance.[18]\nThe worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica\nanymore. We'd been working on YC almost the whole time we'd known\neach other, and we'd neither tried nor wanted to separate it from\nour personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted\ntree.[19]\nOne way to get more precise about the concept of invented vs\ndiscovered is to talk about space aliens. Any sufficiently advanced\nalien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean\ntheorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty, that\nthey would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy's 1960 paper.But if so there's no reason to suppose that this is the limit of\nthe language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need\nnumbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at\nleast one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness\nis preserved.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel\nGackle, Ralph Hazell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj\nTaggar for reading drafts of this.December 2014If the world were static, we could have monotonically increasing\nconfidence in our beliefs.  The more (and more varied) experience\na belief survived, the less likely it would be false.  Most people\nimplicitly believe something like this about their opinions.  And\nthey're justified in doing so with opinions about things that don't\nchange much, like human nature.  But you can't trust your opinions\nin the same way about things that change, which could include\npractically everything else.When experts are wrong, it's often because they're experts on an\nearlier version of the world.Is it possible to avoid that?  Can you protect yourself against\nobsolete beliefs?  To some extent, yes. I spent almost a decade\ninvesting in early stage startups, and curiously enough protecting\nyourself against obsolete beliefs is exactly what you have to do\nto succeed as a startup investor.  Most really good startup ideas\nlook like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad specifically\nbecause some change in the world just switched them from bad to\ngood.  I spent a lot of time learning to recognize such ideas, and\nthe techniques I used may be applicable to ideas in general.The first step is to have an explicit belief in change.  People who\nfall victim to a monotonically increasing confidence in their\nopinions are implicitly concluding the world is static.  If you\nconsciously remind yourself it isn't, you start to look for change.Where should one look for it?  Beyond the moderately useful\ngeneralization that human nature doesn't change much, the unfortunate\nfact is that change is hard to predict.  This is largely a tautology\nbut worth remembering all the same: change that matters usually\ncomes from an unforeseen quarter.So I don't even try to predict it.  When I get asked in interviews\nto predict the future, I always have to struggle to come up with\nsomething plausible-sounding on the fly, like a student who hasn't\nprepared for an exam.\n[1]\nBut it's not out of laziness that I haven't\nprepared.  It seems to me that beliefs about the future are so\nrarely correct that they usually aren't worth the extra rigidity\nthey impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively\nopen-minded.  Instead of trying to point yourself in \nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\nthe right\ndirection, admit you have no idea what the right direction is, and\ntry instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change.It's ok to have working hypotheses, even though they may constrain\nyou a bit, because they also motivate you.  It's exciting to chase\nthings and exciting to try to guess answers.  But you have to be\ndisciplined about not letting your hypotheses harden into anything\nmore.\n[2]I believe this passive m.o. works not just for evaluating new ideas\nbut also for having them.  The way to come up with new ideas is not\nto try explicitly to, but to try to solve problems and simply not\ndiscount weird hunches you have in the process.The winds of change originate in the unconscious minds of domain\nexperts.  If you're sufficiently expert in a field, any weird idea\nor apparently irrelevant question that occurs to you is ipso facto\nworth exploring. \n[3]\n Within Y Combinator, when an idea is described\nas crazy, it's a compliment—in fact, on average probably a\nhigher compliment than when an idea is described as good.Startup investors have extraordinary incentives for correcting\nobsolete beliefs.  If they can realize before other investors that\nsome apparently unpromising startup isn't, they can make a huge\namount of money.  But the incentives are more than just financial.\nInvestors' opinions are explicitly tested: startups come to them\nand they have to say yes or no, and then, fairly quickly, they learn\nwhether they guessed right.  The investors who say no to a Google\n(and there were several) will remember it for the rest of their\nlives.Anyone who must in some sense bet on ideas rather than merely\ncommenting on them has similar incentives.  Which means anyone who\nwants such incentives can have them, by turning their comments into\nbets: if you write about a topic in some fairly durable and public\nform, you'll find you worry much more about getting things right\nthan most people would in a casual conversation.\n[4]Another trick I've found to protect myself against obsolete beliefs\nis to focus initially on people rather than ideas. Though the nature\nof future discoveries is hard to predict, I've found I can predict\nquite well what sort of people will make them.  Good new ideas come\nfrom earnest, energetic, independent-minded people.Betting on people over ideas saved me countless times as an investor.\nWe thought Airbnb was a bad idea, for example. But we could tell\nthe founders were earnest, energetic, and independent-minded.\n(Indeed, almost pathologically so.)  So we suspended disbelief and\nfunded them.This too seems a technique that should be generally applicable.\nSurround yourself with the sort of people new ideas come from.  If\nyou want to notice quickly when your beliefs become obsolete, you\ncan't do better than to be friends with the people whose discoveries\nwill make them so.It's hard enough already not to become the prisoner of your own\nexpertise, but it will only get harder, because change is accelerating.\nThat's not a recent trend; change has been accelerating since the\npaleolithic era.  Ideas beget ideas.  I don't expect that to change.\nBut I could be wrong.\nNotes[1]\nMy usual trick is to talk about aspects of the present that\nmost people haven't noticed yet.[2]\nEspecially if they become well enough known that people start\nto identify them with you.  You have to be extra skeptical about\nthings you want to believe, and once a hypothesis starts to be\nidentified with you, it will almost certainly start to be in that\ncategory.[3]\nIn practice \"sufficiently expert\" doesn't require one to be\nrecognized as an expert—wh\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\nich is a trailing indicator in any\ncase.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost \nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\n$100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whate\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\nver they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to \nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\nyou.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries. \nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\n The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to \nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\nrun fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someon\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\ne is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be intere\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\nsting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of w\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\nindow air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid \nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\nit wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor tha\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nt my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representat\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nion and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art cl\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\nasses at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagin\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\ne,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\nExactly. That was h\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\now I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\nBetter organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\nPainting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of \nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\ndistinctive\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\nof dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\nbest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\ndefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A\nrent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\nUpper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\nNow I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\ndays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers\nof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't\nthat much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work\non whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called\nthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited\nhim in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It\nseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical\nuser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the ne\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\nxt train leaving the station.\nI was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\nwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art\ngalleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy\nones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate\nweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and\nset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up\ngalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.\nIt was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites\nfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that\nexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd\nbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called\nan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy\nof ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write\nsoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to be\nnormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.\nThat was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to\nwrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix\nworld. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new\nsite generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate\nwas away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his\nroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a\nmattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress\nI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran\nthe software on the server, and let users control it by clicking\non links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve\nthem from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at\nthe time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,\nwe decided to try making a version of our store builder that you\ncould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August\n12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you\ncould build a whole store through the browser, without any client\nsoftware or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a\nwhole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't\nneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there\nhad been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to\nbe at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.\nNow you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our\nsoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding\nfrom Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the\ninitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%\nof the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y\nCombinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because\nwe'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand\ndollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by\nwhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside\nthe proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?\nNo, I had not.) So although R\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\nobert had his graduate student stipend,\nI needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious\nabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to\nbuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating\npages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be\ngenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,\nthe links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the\nserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online\nstore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking\nlegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts\nand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his\nbedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because\nit's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but\nin 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a\nmonth,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in\nretrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years\nlater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,\nand I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.\nHe recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because\nat that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything\nin his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with\nhim. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a\nfrighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two\nmost independent-minded people \nI know, and in completely different\nways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a\ncolonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's\nit would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just\nas well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were\nlate, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of\ntalk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually\nwanted online stores.\n[8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which\npeople used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,\nwhich Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and\nstatistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one\nof the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight\nand didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's\nand Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do\nwas work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the\neasiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of\nit stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were\ninstead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second\nhalf of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not\nthe Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It\nwas lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make\nViaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a\nmonth for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low\nprice was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of\ncompetitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we\nset the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.\n$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,\nwe did what's now called \"doing things that \ndon't scale,\" although\nat the time we would have described it as \"being so\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\n lame that we're\ndriven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common\nof which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly\nhumiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that\npeople could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get\nusers.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For\nexample, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt\n(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better\nto have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.\nThe reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to\nrescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were\nso beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.\nBuilding stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it\nfelt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled\nby \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in\ncharge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,\nin much the same way I was converted to \nfatherhood once I had kids.\nWhatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have\nso many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in\nthe meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn't get at the time is that \ngrowth rate is the\nultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about\n70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I\nmistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number\nof users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that\nthat's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough,\nyou might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate\ntakes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was\nadvising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed\nout, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't\nhire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then\nyou'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted\nme to, and partly because that's what startups did during the\nInternet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would\nhave seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about\nwhen Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we\nwere at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.\nAnd since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the\nresult was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb\nstock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable\nand growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had\nno idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of\nthe near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor\nhad I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we\nstarted. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to\nriches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow\n1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were\nby far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must\nhave been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at\nthe time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running\nViaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue\nmy usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue\ncombined with Yahoo's prematurely aged\nculture and grim cube farm\nin Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it\nfelt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had giv\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\nen us a lot of options when they bought us. At the\ntime I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth\nanything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next\nyear. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the\nsummer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything\nthat I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been\nentirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had\ndone this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now\nI was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation\nwith me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures\nI wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an\ninterest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.\nMy options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I\nwas leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to\ngo and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people\nwith me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was\nground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving\nthen to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,\nand yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.\nThere was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich.\nNow when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their\ncompanies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's\nwhat I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing\nfor a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or\nambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people\nin California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in\nthe Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from\nanywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation\nI went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent\ncontrol you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed\nup like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and\nthere were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't\nknow any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was\nrich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns,\nexcept now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was\ntired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless\nit was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked\npast charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It\nwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented\nwith a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the\nold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and\nthen use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted\nfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually\nchoose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and\nvarious real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by\noccasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there\nwasn't one. Huh.Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear\nfrom our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why\nnot build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit\ncode on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting\napplications for them?\n[9]\nYou could run all sorts of services\non the servers that these applications could use just by making an\nAPI call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulatin\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\ng images,\ntaking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything\nelse. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly\nwant to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would\nhave to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and\nstart it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but\nthere I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and\nthough he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into\nworking on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.\nSo while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly\nrefused to work on it.Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had\nworked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and\nwe got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty\ncompanies and several open source projects worth of software. The\nlanguage for defining applications would of course be a dialect of\nLisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt\nLisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan\ndid.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an\n\"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long\nbefore it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current\nfor long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going\nto be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network\ninfrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two\nservices (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the\nsummer I realized I really didn't want to run a company  especially\nnot a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I'd\nonly started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't\nneed money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be\nrealized as a company, then screw the vision. I'd build a subset\nthat could be done as an open source project.Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not\nwasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often\nencounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and\nit was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and\neven trying to write some of it.The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp,\nwhose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp\nhackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the\ndistinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and\npartly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of\nLisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So\nat the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new\ndialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a\ntalk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp\nat Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,\non paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but\nhad never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.\nWhat on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone\nhad posted it on Slashdot.\n[10]Wow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put\nit on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but\nit was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel\nto readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only\nway to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published\nas a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish\nanything.This had been possible in principle since 1993\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\n, but not many people\nhad realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building\nthe infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer\nas well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it\ntook me several years to understand the implications. It meant there\nwould be a whole new generation of \nessays.\n[11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been\nvanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers\nwho went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed\nto publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.\nThere were so many essays that had never been written, because there\nhad been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going\nto write them.\n[12]I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there\nwas a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was\nwhen I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that\nwhatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a \nmarginal medium at first.\nSocially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their\nGeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions\npublished in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to\nfind that encouraging instead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how\nwell it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't\nprestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form\nof painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started\nthem. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what\nI'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish\non my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in\nsomething like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when\nyou find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current\nlack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to\nbe discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.\nImpure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is\ngoing to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.\nSo while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee\nyou're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the\nmost common type of wrong one.Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds\nof different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a\nbook, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I\nalso worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to\nhave dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which\ntaught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in\nCambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn\nstudio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\ndiners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one\nparty. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be\npeople they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\ncalled Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.\nThis bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,\nas she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised\nhow different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So\nshe decided to compile a book of \ninterviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial p\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\nroblems and she had to fire half her\nstaff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed\nfor a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make\nup their minds, and during this time I started telling her about\nall the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They\nshould make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a\nhandful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical\nfounders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as\nCEO, and so on.One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks.\nThe prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people\nand tell them something that won't waste their time is a great\nspur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the\nundergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would\ntell them how to start a startup. Maybe they'd be able to avoid the\nworst of the mistakes we'd made.So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the\nbest sources of seed funding were successful startup founders,\nbecause then they'd be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed\nthey were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect\nof having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known),\nI blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk. But afterward\nit occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about\nangel investing. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now\nit was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects\nwe could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed\nlike there had to be something we could collaborate on.As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the\ncorner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged.\nScrew the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We'd\nstart our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd\nbeen talking about. I'd fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and\nwork for it, and we'd get Robert and Trevor as partners too.\n[13]Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to\nbe angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways\nto learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices,\nand some of the things we did turned out to be novel.There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn't figure\nthem all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm.\nIn those days, those two words didn't go together. There were VC\nfirms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was\nto make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments.\nAnd there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were\nindividuals who were usually focused on other things and made\ninvestments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough\nin the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects,\nbecause we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing\nJulian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us\nset up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software,\nbut actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all\nthat stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to\nmake seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had\ndone for us.YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we\nfunded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers,\nbut professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got\nall the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular\ninsight on our part. We didn'\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\nt know how VC firms were organized.\nIt never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we\nwouldn't have known where to start.\n[14]The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a\nbunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three\nmonths focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we\ndiscovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due\nto our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as\ninvestors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch\nof startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech\ncompanies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where\nthey'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being\nin a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense\nbe fake founders. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out\nof it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and\nthey for their part would probably have a more interesting summer\nthan they would working at Microsoft.We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters.\nWe'd all have dinner there once a week  on tuesdays, since I was\nalready cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays  and after\ndinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a\nmatter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders\nProgram, and I posted an \nannouncement \non my site, inviting undergrads\nto apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way\nto get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be\nthe perfect source.\n[15]\nWe got 225 applications for the Summer\nFounders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them\nwere from people who'd already graduated, or were about to that\nspring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious\nthan we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and\nfrom those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That\nfirst batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went\non to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the\nRSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access,\nand Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.\nI don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.\nYou had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the\nSummer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place\nlike Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did\nwith Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students\ngot for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the\ntypical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to\nbe fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had\ntaken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought\nthe founders free air conditioners.\n[16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale\nstartup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient\nfor us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups\nat once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too.\nIt solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the\nisolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who\nunderstood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they\nwere solving them.As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The\nalumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another,\nand especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being\nin. We also noticed that the startups were becoming on\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\ne another's\ncustomers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YC\ngrows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups\nget their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their\nbatchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going\nto do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew,\nand I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more\nthan a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was\nstill able to work on other things.In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version\nof Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into\nScheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was\noriginally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and\nwas called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of\nreading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders\nwe wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed\nthe name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's\nintellectual curiosity.HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest\nsource of stress for me. If all I'd had to do was select and help\nfounders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN\nwas a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work\nshould at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas\nI was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not\nfrom the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an\nill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during\nYC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40%\nchance it had do with everything else combined.\n[17]As well as HN, I wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc. But\nwhile I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped\nworking on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly\nbecause it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language\nnow that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my\nthree projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on\nYC.YC was different from other kinds of work I've done. Instead of\ndeciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every\n6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems,\nwhatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work,\nbecause their problems were quite varied, and the good founders\nwere very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could\nabout startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have\npicked a better way to do it.There were parts of the job I didn't like. Disputes between cofounders,\nfiguring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who\nmaltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the\nparts I didn't like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once\nsaid about companies: \"No one works harder than the boss.\" He meant\nit both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second\npart that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked\nset the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better\nwork very hard.One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews,\nRobert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited\nadvice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at\nViaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested\nthat it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital.\nThat was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I\nremember his exact words very clearly. \"You know,\" he said, \"you\nshould make sure Y Combinator isn't the last cool thing you do.\"At the time I didn't understand w\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\nhat he meant, but gradually it\ndawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange\nadvice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer\nthan Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me\nthinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be\nthe last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my\nattention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of\neating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave\neventually. And it wasn't, so I would.In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned\nout to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed\nher balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really\nwanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I\nwere determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to\nvisit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those\nflights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to\nsomeone else.I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so\nwe decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and\nTrevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard.\nUp till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we\nfour had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to\ndo that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said\nyes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and\nJessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he\nsaid no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors.\nBut I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided\nhe'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest\nof 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could\nlearn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose\ncancer had returned.She died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was\nstill hard when it did.I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups\nthrough Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still\ntalk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested\nin, but that only takes a few hours a week.)What should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about\nthat. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided\nI'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused\non it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting.\nI was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was\nat least completely engaging.\n[18]I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to\nwork so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had\nbeen. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the\nmiddle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd\nalways been curious to see how the painting I was working on would\nturn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So\nI stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted\nsince. So far anyway.I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum\ngame. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project\nthat's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's\ngetting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was\nsome opportunity cost to screwing around.I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over\nthe next few months. I even wrote a couple that \nweren't about\nstartups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language\ndefined by writing an interpreter i\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nn itself. It wasn't originally\nintended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was\nmeant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the\nTuring machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language\nin itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need?\nThe Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered,\nis an answer to that question.\n[19]McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program\ncomputers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell\ntranslated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language,\nand from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language\nin the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation\ngave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.\nIt was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand\nwhy at the time.McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions.\nIt was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language.\nSo these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined\nusing McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have\nbeen feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by\nhand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting\nclose to the limit of interpreters you could test that way  indeed,\nthere was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more\ncomplicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers\nthen weren't powerful enough.Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's\naxiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language.\nAnd as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a\ndiscoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle,\nend up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to\ndo than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle,\nwhy not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years,\nfrom March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I\nhad a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep\nat it for so long.I wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, \nin itself in Arc. That may sound\nlike a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery\nI had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious\ncollection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an\ninterpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast,\nbut fast enough to test.I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time,\nor I'd never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing\nessays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely\nunderstand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as\nbecause the problem is so convoluted. When you're working on an\ninterpreter written in itself, it's hard to keep track of what's\nhappening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted\nby the time you get them.So I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people\nabout Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have\nseemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder\nthan I'd ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for\nhours with some gruesome bug I'd check Twitter or HN and see someone\nasking \"Does Paul Graham still code?\"Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively\nthat at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head\nand could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the\ncoast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some\nproblem involving continuations while I watched them play in the\ntide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I reme\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\nmber that\nbecause I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news\nis that I had more moments like this over the next few years.In the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to\nsee what it was like living in another country, and since I was a\nBritish citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only\nmeant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still\nlive there. So most of Bel was written in England.In the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's\noriginal Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although\nlike McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics\nI'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also\nstarted to think about other things I could work on. How should I\nchoose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the\npast? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I\nwas surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If\nthis surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would\nbe interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with\nsimilarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others\nto read, and this is the last sentence of it.\nNotes[1]\nMy experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers:\ntime-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from\nbatch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem\nall the more exciting.[2]\nItalian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be\npredicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps\nlike polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you\nstring together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs,\nyou can make a little Italian go a long way.[3]\nI lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia\nwent straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across\nthe bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery,\nand then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at\nstreet level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter\nevenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with\ntourists.[4]\nYou can of course paint people like still lives if you want\nto, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex\nof still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce\npained expressions in the sitters.[5]\nInterleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and\nbuilt impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law.\nIn the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e.\nIntel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and\nsoftware companies like a bulldozer.[6]\nThe signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically\nmercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled.\nAnything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as\ncool will soon become equally expensive.[7]\nTechnically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but\nrent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would\nknow or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less\nthan half market price.[8]\nMost software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when\nthe software is an online store builder and you're hosting the\nstores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully\nobvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch\nprivately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and\nmaking sure they had decent-looking stores.[9]\nWe'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their\nown page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp\nexpressions underneath. But this \nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\nwasn't an app editor, because the\ncode ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers\nvisited them.[10]\nThis was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience,\nand so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found\nthey were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was\nbetter than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete?\nPeople who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me\nhow sorry they feel for me, but I'm not exaggerating when I reply\nthat it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It\ncomes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they\ndon't already know, and some \npeople dislike being told such things.[11]\nPeople put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of\ncourse, but putting something online is not the same as publishing\nit online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as\nthe (or at least a) primary version.[12]\nThere is a general lesson here that our experience with Y\nCombinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long\nafter the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary\nVC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays,\nbeen based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more\nexpensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap\nand common, but the VCs' customs still reflected the old world,\njust as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints\nof the print era.Which in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e.\nless influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected\nby rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).Here's an interesting point, though: you can't always predict which\nfields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and\nventure capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay\nwriting would be?[13]\nY Combinator was not the original name. At first we were\ncalled Cambridge Seed. But we didn't want a regional name, in case\nsomeone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after\none of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.I picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and\npartly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors\nlike maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying\nto appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside\njoke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made\nthe YC logo a white Y on an orange square.[14]\nYC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009,\nbecause it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it\npersonally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go\nback to being self-funded.[15]\nI've never liked the term \"deal flow,\" because it implies\nthat the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This\nis not only false, but it's the purpose of YC to falsify it, by\ncausing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.[16]\nShe reports that they were all different shapes and sizes,\nbecause there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get\nwhatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could\ncarry now.[17]\nAnother problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs\nwhen you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum,\nyou're assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every\nconversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post\nhighly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually\nthese two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination\nis disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations,\nbecause the assumption that \nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\nyou're present in the conversation means\nthat not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation\nreads as a tacit admission that it's correct. But that in turn\nencourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses\nthat now is their chance.[18]\nThe worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica\nanymore. We'd been working on YC almost the whole time we'd known\neach other, and we'd neither tried nor wanted to separate it from\nour personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted\ntree.[19]\nOne way to get more precise about the concept of invented vs\ndiscovered is to talk about space aliens. Any sufficiently advanced\nalien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean\ntheorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty, that\nthey would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy's 1960 paper.But if so there's no reason to suppose that this is the limit of\nthe language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need\nnumbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at\nleast one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness\nis preserved.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel\nGackle, Ralph Hazell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj\nTaggar for reading drafts of this.December 2014If the world were static, we could have monotonically increasing\nconfidence in our beliefs.  The more (and more varied) experience\na belief survived, the less likely it would be false.  Most people\nimplicitly believe something like this about their opinions.  And\nthey're justified in doing so with opinions about things that don't\nchange much, like human nature.  But you can't trust your opinions\nin the same way about things that change, which could include\npractically everything else.When experts are wrong, it's often because they're experts on an\nearlier version of the world.Is it possible to avoid that?  Can you protect yourself against\nobsolete beliefs?  To some extent, yes. I spent almost a decade\ninvesting in early stage startups, and curiously enough protecting\nyourself against obsolete beliefs is exactly what you have to do\nto succeed as a startup investor.  Most really good startup ideas\nlook like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad specifically\nbecause some change in the world just switched them from bad to\ngood.  I spent a lot of time learning to recognize such ideas, and\nthe techniques I used may be applicable to ideas in general.The first step is to have an explicit belief in change.  People who\nfall victim to a monotonically increasing confidence in their\nopinions are implicitly concluding the world is static.  If you\nconsciously remind yourself it isn't, you start to look for change.Where should one look for it?  Beyond the moderately useful\ngeneralization that human nature doesn't change much, the unfortunate\nfact is that change is hard to predict.  This is largely a tautology\nbut worth remembering all the same: change that matters usually\ncomes from an unforeseen quarter.So I don't even try to predict it.  When I get asked in interviews\nto predict the future, I always have to struggle to come up with\nsomething plausible-sounding on the fly, like a student who hasn't\nprepared for an exam.\n[1]\nBut it's not out of laziness that I haven't\nprepared.  It seems to me that beliefs about the future are so\nrarely correct that they usually aren't worth the extra rigidity\nthey impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively\nopen-minded.  Instead of trying to point yourself in the right\ndirection, admit you have no idea what the right direction is, and\ntry instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change.It's ok to have working h\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\nypotheses, even though they may constrain\nyou a bit, because they also motivate you.  It's exciting to chase\nthings and exciting to try to guess answers.  But you have to be\ndisciplined about not letting your hypotheses harden into anything\nmore.\n[2]I believe this passive m.o. works not just for evaluating new ideas\nbut also for having them.  The way to come up with new ideas is not\nto try explicitly to, but to try to solve problems and simply not\ndiscount weird hunches you have in the process.The winds of change originate in the unconscious minds of domain\nexperts.  If you're sufficiently expert in a field, any weird idea\nor apparently irrelevant question that occurs to you is ipso facto\nworth exploring. \n[3]\n Within Y Combinator, when an idea is described\nas crazy, it's a compliment—in fact, on average probably a\nhigher compliment than when an idea is described as good.Startup investors have extraordinary incentives for correcting\nobsolete beliefs.  If they can realize before other investors that\nsome apparently unpromising startup isn't, they can make a huge\namount of money.  But the incentives are more than just financial.\nInvestors' opinions are explicitly tested: startups come to them\nand they have to say yes or no, and then, fairly quickly, they learn\nwhether they guessed right.  The investors who say no to a Google\n(and there were several) will remember it for the rest of their\nlives.Anyone who must in some sense bet on ideas rather than merely\ncommenting on them has similar incentives.  Which means anyone who\nwants such incentives can have them, by turning their comments into\nbets: if you write about a topic in some fairly durable and public\nform, you'll find you worry much more about getting things right\nthan most people would in a casual conversation.\n[4]Another trick I've found to protect myself against obsolete beliefs\nis to focus initially on people rather than ideas. Though the nature\nof future discoveries is hard to predict, I've found I can predict\nquite well what sort of people will make them.  Good new ideas come\nfrom earnest, energetic, independent-minded people.Betting on people over ideas saved me countless times as an investor.\nWe thought Airbnb was a bad idea, for example. But we could tell\nthe founders were earnest, energetic, and independent-minded.\n(Indeed, almost pathologically so.)  So we suspended disbelief and\nfunded them.This too seems a technique that should be generally applicable.\nSurround yourself with the sort of people new ideas come from.  If\nyou want to notice quickly when your beliefs become obsolete, you\ncan't do better than to be friends with the people whose discoveries\nwill make them so.It's hard enough already not to become the prisoner of your own\nexpertise, but it will only get harder, because change is accelerating.\nThat's not a recent trend; change has been accelerating since the\npaleolithic era.  Ideas beget ideas.  I don't expect that to change.\nBut I could be wrong.\nNotes[1]\nMy usual trick is to talk about aspects of the present that\nmost people haven't noticed yet.[2]\nEspecially if they become well enough known that people start\nto identify them with you.  You have to be extra skeptical about\nthings you want to believe, and once a hypothesis starts to be\nidentified with you, it will almost certainly start to be in that\ncategory.[3]\nIn practice \"sufficiently expert\" doesn't require one to be\nrecognized as an expert—which is a trailing indicator in any\ncase.  In many fields a year of focused work plus caring a lot would\nbe enough.[4]\nThough they are public and persist indefinitely, comments on\ne.g. forums and places like Twitter seem empirically to work like\ncasual conversation.  The threshold may\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\n be whether what you write\nhas a title.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, and Robert Morris\nfor reading drafts of this.\n\nWant to start a startup?  Get funded by\nY Combinator.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 2006To do something well you have to like it.   That idea is not exactly\nnovel.  We've got it down to four words: \"Do what you love.\"  But\nit's not enough just to tell people that.  Doing what you love is\ncomplicated.The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids.  When I\nwas a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition.\nLife had two states: some of the time adults were making you do\nthings, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could\ndo what you wanted, and that was called playing.  Occasionally the\nthings adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing\nwasn't—for example, if you fell and hurt yourself.  But except\nfor these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as\nnot-fun.And it did not seem to be an accident. School, it was implied, was\ntedious because it was preparation for grownup work.The world then was divided into two groups, grownups and kids.\nGrownups, like some kind of cursed race, had to work.  Kids didn't,\nbut they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version of\nwork meant to prepare us for the real thing.  Much as we disliked\nschool, the grownups all agreed that grownup work was worse, and\nthat we had it easy.Teachers in particular all seemed to believe implicitly that work\nwas not fun.  Which is not surprising: work wasn't fun for most of\nthem.  Why did we have to memorize state capitals instead of playing\ndodgeball?  For the same reason they had to watch over a bunch of\nkids instead of lying on a beach.  You couldn't just do what you\nwanted.I'm not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want.\nThey may have to be made to work on certain things.  But if we make\nkids work on dull stuff, it might be wise to tell them that tediousness\nis not the defining quality of work, and indeed that the reason\nthey have to work on dull stuff now is so they can work on more\ninteresting stuff later.\n[1]Once, when I was about 9 or 10, my father told me I could be whatever\nI wanted when I grew up, so long as I enjoyed it.  I remember that\nprecisely because it seemed so anomalous.  It was like being told\nto use dry water.  Whatever I thought he meant, I didn't think he\nmeant work could literally be fun—fun like playing.  It\ntook me years to grasp that.JobsBy high school, the prospect of an actual job was on the horizon.\nAdults would sometimes come to speak to us about their work, or we\nwould go to see them at work.  It was always understood that they\nenjoyed what they did.  In retrospect I think one may have: the\nprivate jet pilot.  But I don't think the bank manager really did.The main reason they all acted as if they enjoyed their work was\npresumably the upper-middle class convention that you're supposed\nto.  It would not merely be bad for your career to say that you\ndespised your job, but a social faux-pas.Why is it conventional to pretend to like what you do?  The first\nsentence of this essay explains that.  If you have to like something\nto do it well, then the most successful people will all like what\nthey do.  That's where the upper-middle class tradition comes from.\nJust as houses all over America are full of \nchairs\nthat are, without\nthe owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of chairs designed\n250 years ago for French kings, conventional attitudes about work\nare, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of\nthe attitudes of people who've done great things.What a recipe for alienation.  By the time they reach an age to\nthink about what they'd like to\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\n do, most kids have been thoroughly\nmisled about the idea of loving one's work.  School has trained\nthem to regard work as an unpleasant duty.  Having a job is said\nto be even more onerous than schoolwork.  And yet all the adults\nclaim to like what they do.  You can't blame kids for thinking \"I\nam not like these people; I am not suited to this world.\"Actually they've been told three lies: the stuff they've been taught\nto regard as work in school is not real work; grownup work is not\n(necessarily) worse than schoolwork; and many of the adults around\nthem are lying when they say they like what they do.The most dangerous liars can be the kids' own parents.  If you take\na boring job to give your family a high standard of living, as so\nmany people do, you risk infecting your kids with the idea that\nwork is boring. \n[2]\nMaybe it would be better for kids in this one\ncase if parents were not so unselfish.  A parent who set an example\nof loving their work might help their kids more than an expensive\nhouse.\n[3]It was not\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the \nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\nfourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\n,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go to the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\n\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another \nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nquestion. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partl\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\ny to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intended for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is \nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\njust a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don't have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his nam\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\ne on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe produ\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\ncts.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginni\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\nng writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't t\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove thi\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nngs, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas t\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\no get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\n're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too man\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\ny people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\nBetter organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\nPainting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\nof dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\nbest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\ndefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A\nrent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\nUpper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\nNow I was a New York artist  i\nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\nn the strictly technical sense of\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\ndays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers\nof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't\nthat much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work\non whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called\nthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited\nhim in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It\nseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical\nuser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.\nI was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\nwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art\ngalleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy\nones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate\nweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and\nset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up\ngalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.\nIt was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites\nfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that\nexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd\nbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called\nan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy\nof ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write\nsoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to be\nnormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.\nThat was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to\nwrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix\nworld. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new\nsite generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate\nwas away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his\nroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a\nmattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress\nI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran\nthe software on the server, and let users control it by clicking\non links? Then we'd never have \nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\nto write anything to run on users'\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve\nthem from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at\nthe time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,\nwe decided to try making a version of our store builder that you\ncould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August\n12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you\ncould build a whole store through the browser, without any client\nsoftware or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a\nwhole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't\nneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there\nhad been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to\nbe at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.\nNow you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our\nsoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding\nfrom Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the\ninitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%\nof the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y\nCombinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because\nwe'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand\ndollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by\nwhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside\nthe proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?\nNo, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,\nI needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious\nabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to\nbuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating\npages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be\ngenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,\nthe links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the\nserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online\nstore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking\nlegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts\nand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his\nbedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because\nit's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but\nin 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a\nmonth,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in\nretrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years\nlater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,\nand I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.\nHe recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because\nat that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything\nin his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with\nhim. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a\nfrighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two\nmost independent-minded people \nI know, and in completely different\nways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a\ncolonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's\nit would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just\nas well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were\nlate, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of\ntalk in the pres\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\ns then about ecommerce, but not many people actually\nwanted online stores.\n[8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which\npeople used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,\nwhich Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and\nstatistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one\nof the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight\nand didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's\nand Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do\nwas work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the\neasiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of\nit stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were\ninstead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second\nhalf of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not\nthe Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It\nwas lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make\nViaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a\nmonth for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low\nprice was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of\ncompetitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we\nset the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.\n$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,\nwe did what's now called \"doing things that \ndon't scale,\" although\nat the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're\ndriven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common\nof which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly\nhumiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that\npeople could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get\nusers.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For\nexample, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt\n(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better\nto have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.\nThe reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to\nrescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were\nso beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.\nBuilding stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it\nfelt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled\nby \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in\ncharge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,\nin much the same way I was converted to \nfatherhood once I had kids.\nWhatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have\nso many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in\nthe meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn't get at the time is that \ngrowth rate is the\nultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about\n70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I\nmistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number\nof users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that\nthat's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough,\nyou might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate\ntakes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was\nadvising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed\nout, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't\nhire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then\nyou'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted\nme to, and partly because that's what startups did during the\nInternet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would\n\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\nhave seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about\nwhen Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we\nwere at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.\nAnd since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the\nresult was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb\nstock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable\nand growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had\nno idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of\nthe near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor\nhad I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we\nstarted. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to\nriches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow\n1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were\nby far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must\nhave been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at\nthe time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running\nViaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue\nmy usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue\ncombined with Yahoo's prematurely aged\nculture and grim cube farm\nin Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it\nfelt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the\ntime I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth\nanything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next\nyear. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the\nsummer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything\nthat I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been\nentirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had\ndone this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now\nI was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation\nwith me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures\nI wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an\ninterest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.\nMy options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I\nwas leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to\ngo and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people\nwith me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was\nground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving\nthen to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,\nand yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.\nThere was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich.\nNow when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their\ncompanies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's\nwhat I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing\nfor a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or\nambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people\nin California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in\nthe Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from\nanywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation\nI went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent\ncontrol you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed\nup like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and\nthere were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't\nknow any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was\nrich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my o\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\nld patterns,\nexcept now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was\ntired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless\nit was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked\npast charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It\nwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented\nwith a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the\nold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and\nthen use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted\nfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually\nchoose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and\nvarious real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by\noccasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there\nwasn't one. Huh.Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear\nfrom our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why\nnot build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit\ncode on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting\napplications for them?\n[9]\nYou could run all sorts of services\non the servers that these applications could use just by making an\nAPI call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images,\ntaking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything\nelse. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly\nwant to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would\nhave to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and\nstart it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but\nthere I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and\nthough he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into\nworking on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.\nSo while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly\nrefused to work on it.Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had\nworked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and\nwe got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty\ncompanies and several open source projects worth of software. The\nlanguage for defining applications would of course be a dialect of\nLisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt\nLisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan\ndid.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an\n\"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long\nbefore it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current\nfor long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going\nto be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network\ninfrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two\nservices (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the\nsummer I realized I really didn't want to run a company  especially\nnot a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I'd\nonly started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't\nneed money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be\nrealized as a company, then screw the vision. I'd build a subset\nthat could be done as an open source project.Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not\nwasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often\nencounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and\nit was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and\neven trying to write some of it.The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp,\nwhose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp\nhackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the\ndis\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\ntinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and\npartly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of\nLisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So\nat the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new\ndialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a\ntalk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp\nat Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,\non paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but\nhad never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.\nWhat on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone\nhad posted it on Slashdot.\n[10]Wow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put\nit on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but\nit was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel\nto readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only\nway to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published\nas a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish\nanything.This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people\nhad realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building\nthe infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer\nas well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it\ntook me several years to understand the implications. It meant there\nwould be a whole new generation of \nessays.\n[11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been\nvanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers\nwho went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed\nto publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.\nThere were so many essays that had never been written, because there\nhad been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going\nto write them.\n[12]I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there\nwas a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was\nwhen I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that\nwhatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a \nmarginal medium at first.\nSocially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their\nGeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions\npublished in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to\nfind that encouraging instead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how\nwell it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't\nprestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form\nof painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started\nthem. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what\nI'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish\non my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in\nsomething like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when\nyou find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current\nlack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to\nbe discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.\nImpure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is\ngoing to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.\nSo while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee\nyou're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the\nmost common type of wrong one.Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds\nof different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a\nbook, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I\nalso worked on spam filters, \nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\nand did some more painting. I used to\nhave dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which\ntaught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in\nCambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn\nstudio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\ndiners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one\nparty. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be\npeople they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\ncalled Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.\nThis bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,\nas she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised\nhow different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So\nshe decided to compile a book of \ninterviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her\nstaff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed\nfor a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make\nup their minds, and during this time I started telling her about\nall the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They\nshould make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a\nhandful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical\nfounders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as\nCEO, and so on.One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks.\nThe prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people\nand tell them something that won't waste their time is a great\nspur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the\nundergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would\ntell them how to start a startup. Maybe they'd be able to avoid the\nworst of the mistakes we'd made.So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the\nbest sources of seed funding were successful startup founders,\nbecause then they'd be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed\nthey were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect\nof having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known),\nI blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk. But afterward\nit occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about\nangel investing. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now\nit was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects\nwe could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed\nlike there had to be something we could collaborate on.As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the\ncorner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged.\nScrew the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We'd\nstart our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd\nbeen talking about. I'd fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and\nwork for it, and we'd get Robert and Trevor as partners too.\n[13]Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to\nbe angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways\nto learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices,\nand some of the things we did turned out to be novel.There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn't figure\nthem all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm.\nIn those days, those two words didn't go together. There were VC\nfirms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was\nto make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments.\nAnd there wer\nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\ne angels, who did smaller investments, but these were\nindividuals who were usually focused on other things and made\ninvestments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough\nin the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects,\nbecause we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing\nJulian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us\nset up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software,\nbut actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all\nthat stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to\nmake seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had\ndone for us.YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we\nfunded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers,\nbut professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got\nall the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular\ninsight on our part. We didn't know how VC firms were organized.\nIt never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we\nwouldn't have known where to start.\n[14]The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a\nbunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three\nmonths focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we\ndiscovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due\nto our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as\ninvestors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch\nof startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech\ncompanies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where\nthey'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being\nin a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense\nbe fake founders. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out\nof it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and\nthey for their part would probably have a more interesting summer\nthan they would working at Microsoft.We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters.\nWe'd all have dinner there once a week  on tuesdays, since I was\nalready cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays  and after\ndinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a\nmatter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders\nProgram, and I posted an \nannouncement \non my site, inviting undergrads\nto apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way\nto get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be\nthe perfect source.\n[15]\nWe got 225 applications for the Summer\nFounders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them\nwere from people who'd already graduated, or were about to that\nspring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious\nthan we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and\nfrom those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That\nfirst batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went\non to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the\nRSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access,\nand Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.\nI don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.\nYou had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the\nSummer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place\nlike Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did\nwith Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students\ngot for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the\ntypical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to\nbe fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves ha\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\nd\ntaken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought\nthe founders free air conditioners.\n[16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale\nstartup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient\nfor us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups\nat once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too.\nIt solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the\nisolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who\nunderstood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they\nwere solving them.As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The\nalumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another,\nand especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being\nin. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's\ncustomers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YC\ngrows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups\nget their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their\nbatchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going\nto do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew,\nand I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more\nthan a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was\nstill able to work on other things.In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version\nof Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into\nScheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was\noriginally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and\nwas called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of\nreading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders\nwe wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed\nthe name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's\nintellectual curiosity.HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest\nsource of stress for me. If all I'd had to do was select and help\nfounders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN\nwas a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work\nshould at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas\nI was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not\nfrom the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an\nill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during\nYC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40%\nchance it had do with everything else combined.\n[17]As well as HN, I wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc. But\nwhile I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped\nworking on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly\nbecause it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language\nnow that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my\nthree projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on\nYC.YC was different from other kinds of work I've done. Instead of\ndeciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every\n6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems,\nwhatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work,\nbecause their problems were quite varied, and the good founders\nwere very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could\nabout startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have\npicked a better way to do it.There were parts of the job I didn't like. Disputes between cofounders,\nfiguring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who\nmaltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the\nparts I didn't like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once\nsaid about companies: \"No one works harder than the boss.\" He meant\nit both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the\nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\n second\npart that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked\nset the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better\nwork very hard.One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews,\nRobert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited\nadvice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at\nViaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested\nthat it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital.\nThat was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I\nremember his exact words very clearly. \"You know,\" he said, \"you\nshould make sure Y Combinator isn't the last cool thing you do.\"At the time I didn't understand what he meant, but gradually it\ndawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange\nadvice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer\nthan Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me\nthinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be\nthe last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my\nattention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of\neating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave\neventually. And it wasn't, so I would.In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned\nout to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed\nher balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really\nwanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I\nwere determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to\nvisit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those\nflights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to\nsomeone else.I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so\nwe decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and\nTrevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard.\nUp till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we\nfour had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to\ndo that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said\nyes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and\nJessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he\nsaid no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors.\nBut I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided\nhe'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest\nof 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could\nlearn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose\ncancer had returned.She died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was\nstill hard when it did.I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups\nthrough Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still\ntalk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested\nin, but that only takes a few hours a week.)What should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about\nthat. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided\nI'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused\non it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting.\nI was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was\nat least completely engaging.\n[18]I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to\nwork so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had\nbeen. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the\nmiddle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd\nalways been curious to see how the painting I was working on would\nturn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So\nI stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted\nsince. So far anyway.I re\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\nalize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum\ngame. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project\nthat's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's\ngetting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was\nsome opportunity cost to screwing around.I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over\nthe next few months. I even wrote a couple that \nweren't about\nstartups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language\ndefined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally\nintended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was\nmeant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the\nTuring machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language\nin itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need?\nThe Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered,\nis an answer to that question.\n[19]McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program\ncomputers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell\ntranslated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language,\nand from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language\nin the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation\ngave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.\nIt was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand\nwhy at the time.McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions.\nIt was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language.\nSo these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined\nusing McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have\nbeen feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by\nhand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting\nclose to the limit of interpreters you could test that way  indeed,\nthere was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more\ncomplicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers\nthen weren't powerful enough.Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's\naxiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language.\nAnd as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a\ndiscoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle,\nend up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to\ndo than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle,\nwhy not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years,\nfrom March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I\nhad a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep\nat it for so long.I wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, \nin itself in Arc. That may sound\nlike a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery\nI had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious\ncollection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an\ninterpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast,\nbut fast enough to test.I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time,\nor I'd never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing\nessays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely\nunderstand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as\nbecause the problem is so convoluted. When you're working on an\ninterpreter written in itself, it's hard to keep track of what's\nhappening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted\nby the time you get them.So I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people\nabout Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have\nseemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder\nthan I'd ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for\nhours with some gruesome bu\nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\ng I'd check Twitter or HN and see someone\nasking \"Does Paul Graham still code?\"Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively\nthat at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head\nand could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the\ncoast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some\nproblem involving continuations while I watched them play in the\ntide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that\nbecause I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news\nis that I had more moments like this over the next few years.In the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to\nsee what it was like living in another country, and since I was a\nBritish citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only\nmeant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still\nlive there. So most of Bel was written in England.In the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's\noriginal Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although\nlike McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics\nI'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also\nstarted to think about other things I could work on. How should I\nchoose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the\npast? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I\nwas surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If\nthis surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would\nbe interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with\nsimilarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others\nto read, and this is the last sentence of it.\nNotes[1]\nMy experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers:\ntime-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from\nbatch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem\nall the more exciting.[2]\nItalian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be\npredicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps\nlike polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you\nstring together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs,\nyou can make a little Italian go a long way.[3]\nI lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia\nwent straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across\nthe bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery,\nand then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at\nstreet level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter\nevenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with\ntourists.[4]\nYou can of course paint people like still lives if you want\nto, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex\nof still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce\npained expressions in the sitters.[5]\nInterleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and\nbuilt impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law.\nIn the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e.\nIntel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and\nsoftware companies like a bulldozer.[6]\nThe signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically\nmercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled.\nAnything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as\ncool will soon become equally expensive.[7]\nTechnically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but\nrent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would\nknow or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less\nthan half market price.[8]\nMost software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when\nthe software is an online store builder and you're hosting the\nstores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be \nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\npainfully\nobvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch\nprivately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and\nmaking sure they had decent-looking stores.[9]\nWe'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their\nown page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp\nexpressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the\ncode ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers\nvisited them.[10]\nThis was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience,\nand so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found\nthey were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was\nbetter than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete?\nPeople who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me\nhow sorry they feel for me, but I'm not exaggerating when I reply\nthat it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It\ncomes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they\ndon't already know, and some \npeople dislike being told such things.[11]\nPeople put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of\ncourse, but putting something online is not the same as publishing\nit online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as\nthe (or at least a) primary version.[12]\nThere is a general lesson here that our experience with Y\nCombinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long\nafter the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary\nVC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays,\nbeen based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more\nexpensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap\nand common, but the VCs' customs still reflected the old world,\njust as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints\nof the print era.Which in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e.\nless influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected\nby rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).Here's an interesting point, though: you can't always predict which\nfields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and\nventure capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay\nwriting would be?[13]\nY Combinator was not the original name. At first we were\ncalled Cambridge Seed. But we didn't want a regional name, in case\nsomeone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after\none of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.I picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and\npartly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors\nlike maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying\nto appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside\njoke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made\nthe YC logo a white Y on an orange square.[14]\nYC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009,\nbecause it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it\npersonally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go\nback to being self-funded.[15]\nI've never liked the term \"deal flow,\" because it implies\nthat the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This\nis not only false, but it's the purpose of YC to falsify it, by\ncausing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.[16]\nShe reports that they were all different shapes and sizes,\nbecause there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get\nwhatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could\ncarry now.[17]\nAnother problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs\nwhen you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum,\nyou're assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every\nconversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post\nhighly imaginative \nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\nmisinterpretations of them on forums. Individually\nthese two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination\nis disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations,\nbecause the assumption that you're present in the conversation means\nthat not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation\nreads as a tacit admission that it's correct. But that in turn\nencourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses\nthat now is their chance.[18]\nThe worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica\nanymore. We'd been working on YC almost the whole time we'd known\neach other, and we'd neither tried nor wanted to separate it from\nour personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted\ntree.[19]\nOne way to get more precise about the concept of invented vs\ndiscovered is to talk about space aliens. Any sufficiently advanced\nalien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean\ntheorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty, that\nthey would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy's 1960 paper.But if so there's no reason to suppose that this is the limit of\nthe language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need\nnumbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at\nleast one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness\nis preserved.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel\nGackle, Ralph Hazell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj\nTaggar for reading drafts of this.December 2014If the world were static, we could have monotonically increasing\nconfidence in our beliefs.  The more (and more varied) experience\na belief survived, the less likely it would be false.  Most people\nimplicitly believe something like this about their opinions.  And\nthey're justified in doing so with opinions about things that don't\nchange much, like human nature.  But you can't trust your opinions\nin the same way about things that change, which could include\npractically everything else.When experts are wrong, it's often because they're experts on an\nearlier version of the world.Is it possible to avoid that?  Can you protect yourself against\nobsolete beliefs?  To some extent, yes. I spent almost a decade\ninvesting in early stage startups, and curiously enough protecting\nyourself against obsolete beliefs is exactly what you have to do\nto succeed as a startup investor.  Most really good startup ideas\nlook like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad specifically\nbecause some change in the world just switched them from bad to\ngood.  I spent a lot of time learning to recognize such ideas, and\nthe techniques I used may be applicable to ideas in general.The first step is to have an explicit belief in change.  People who\nfall victim to a monotonically increasing confidence in their\nopinions are implicitly concluding the world is static.  If you\nconsciously remind yourself it isn't, you start to look for change.Where should one look for it?  Beyond the moderately useful\ngeneralization that human nature doesn't change much, the unfortunate\nfact is that change is hard to predict.  This is largely a tautology\nbut worth remembering all the same: change that matters usually\ncomes from an unforeseen quarter.So I don't even try to predict it.  When I get asked in interviews\nto predict the future, I always have to struggle to come up with\nsomething plausible-sounding on the fly, like a student who hasn't\nprepared for an exam.\n[1]\nBut it's not out of laziness that I haven't\nprepared.  It seems to me that beliefs about the future are so\nrarely correct that they usually aren't worth the extra rigidity\nthey impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively\nopen-minded.  Instead of trying to point yourself in the right\ndirection, admit you have no idea what the right direction\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\n is, and\ntry instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change.It's ok to have working hypotheses, even though they may constrain\nyou a bit, because they also motivate you.  It's exciting to chase\nthings and exciting to try to guess answers.  But you have to be\ndisciplined about not letting your hypotheses harden into anything\nmore.\n[2]I believe this passive m.o. works not just for evaluating new ideas\nbut also for having them.  The way to come up with new ideas is not\nto try explicitly to, but to try to solve problems and simply not\ndiscount weird hunches you have in the process.The winds of change originate in the unconscious minds of domain\nexperts.  If you're sufficiently expert in a field, any weird idea\nor apparently irrelevant question that occurs to you is ipso facto\nworth exploring. \n[3]\n Within Y Combinator, when an idea is described\nas crazy, it's a compliment—in fact, on average probably a\nhigher compliment than when an idea is described as good.Startup investors have extraordinary incentives for correcting\nobsolete beliefs.  If they can realize before other investors that\nsome apparently unpromising startup isn't, they can make a huge\namount of money.  But the incentives are more than just financial.\nInvestors' opinions are explicitly tested: startups come to them\nand they have to say yes or no, and then, fairly quickly, they learn\nwhether they guessed right.  The investors who say no to a Google\n(and there were several) will remember it for the rest of their\nlives.Anyone who must in some sense bet on ideas rather than merely\ncommenting on them has similar incentives.  Which means anyone who\nwants such incentives can have them, by turning their comments into\nbets: if you write about a topic in some fairly durable and public\nform, you'll find you worry much more about getting things right\nthan most people would in a casual conversation.\n[4]Another trick I've found to protect myself against obsolete beliefs\nis to focus initially on people rather than ideas. Though the nature\nof future discoveries is hard to predict, I've found I can predict\nquite well what sort of people will make them.  Good new ideas come\nfrom earnest, energetic, independent-minded people.Betting on people over ideas saved me countless times as an investor.\nWe thought Airbnb was a bad idea, for example. But we could tell\nthe founders were earnest, energetic, and independent-minded.\n(Indeed, almost pathologically so.)  So we suspended disbelief and\nfunded them.This too seems a technique that should be generally applicable.\nSurround yourself with the sort of people new ideas come from.  If\nyou want to notice quickly when your beliefs become obsolete, you\ncan't do better than to be friends with the people whose discoveries\nwill make them so.It's hard enough already not to become the prisoner of your own\nexpertise, but it will only get harder, because change is accelerating.\nThat's not a recent trend; change has been accelerating since the\npaleolithic era.  Ideas beget ideas.  I don't expect that to change.\nBut I could be wrong.\nNotes[1]\nMy usual trick is to talk about aspects of the present that\nmost people haven't noticed yet.[2]\nEspecially if they become well enough known that people start\nto identify them with you.  You have to be extra skeptical about\nthings you want to believe, and once a hypothesis starts to be\nidentified with you, it will almost certainly start to be in that\ncategory.[3]\nIn practice \"sufficiently expert\" doesn't require one to be\nrecognized as an expert—which is a trailing indicator in any\ncase.  In many fields a year of focused work plus caring a lot would\nbe enough.[4]\nThough they are public and persist indefinitely, comments on\ne.g. forums and places like Twitter seem empirically to work like\ncasual conversation.  The threshold may be whether what you write\nhas a t\nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\nitle.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, and Robert Morris\nfor reading drafts of this.\n\nWant to start a startup?  Get funded by\nY Combinator.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 2006To do something well you have to like it.   That idea is not exactly\nnovel.  We've got it down to four words: \"Do what you love.\"  But\nit's not enough just to tell people that.  Doing what you love is\ncomplicated.The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids.  When I\nwas a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition.\nLife had two states: some of the time adults were making you do\nthings, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could\ndo what you wanted, and that was called playing.  Occasionally the\nthings adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing\nwasn't—for example, if you fell and hurt yourself.  But except\nfor these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as\nnot-fun.And it did not seem to be an accident. School, it was implied, was\ntedious because it was preparation for grownup work.The world then was divided into two groups, grownups and kids.\nGrownups, like some kind of cursed race, had to work.  Kids didn't,\nbut they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version of\nwork meant to prepare us for the real thing.  Much as we disliked\nschool, the grownups all agreed that grownup work was worse, and\nthat we had it easy.Teachers in particular all seemed to believe implicitly that work\nwas not fun.  Which is not surprising: work wasn't fun for most of\nthem.  Why did we have to memorize state capitals instead of playing\ndodgeball?  For the same reason they had to watch over a bunch of\nkids instead of lying on a beach.  You couldn't just do what you\nwanted.I'm not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want.\nThey may have to be made to work on certain things.  But if we make\nkids work on dull stuff, it might be wise to tell them that tediousness\nis not the defining quality of work, and indeed that the reason\nthey have to work on dull stuff now is so they can work on more\ninteresting stuff later.\n[1]Once, when I was about 9 or 10, my father told me I could be whatever\nI wanted when I grew up, so long as I enjoyed it.  I remember that\nprecisely because it seemed so anomalous.  It was like being told\nto use dry water.  Whatever I thought he meant, I didn't think he\nmeant work could literally be fun—fun like playing.  It\ntook me years to grasp that.JobsBy high school, the prospect of an actual job was on the horizon.\nAdults would sometimes come to speak to us about their work, or we\nwould go to see them at work.  It was always understood that they\nenjoyed what they did.  In retrospect I think one may have: the\nprivate jet pilot.  But I don't think the bank manager really did.The main reason they all acted as if they enjoyed their work was\npresumably the upper-middle class convention that you're supposed\nto.  It would not merely be bad for your career to say that you\ndespised your job, but a social faux-pas.Why is it conventional to pretend to like what you do?  The first\nsentence of this essay explains that.  If you have to like something\nto do it well, then the most successful people will all like what\nthey do.  That's where the upper-middle class tradition comes from.\nJust as houses all over America are full of \nchairs\nthat are, without\nthe owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of chairs designed\n250 years ago for French kings, conventional attitudes about work\nare, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of\nthe attitudes of people who've done great things.What a recipe for alienation.  By the time they reach an age to\nthink about what they'd like to do, most kids have been thoroughly\nmisled about the idea of loving one's work.  School has trained\nthem to regard work as an unpleasant duty.  Having a job is\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\n said\nto be even more onerous than schoolwork.  And yet all the adults\nclaim to like what they do.  You can't blame kids for thinking \"I\nam not like these people; I am not suited to this world.\"Actually they've been told three lies: the stuff they've been taught\nto regard as work in school is not real work; grownup work is not\n(necessarily) worse than schoolwork; and many of the adults around\nthem are lying when they say they like what they do.The most dangerous liars can be the kids' own parents.  If you take\na boring job to give your family a high standard of living, as so\nmany people do, you risk infecting your kids with the idea that\nwork is boring. \n[2]\nMaybe it would be better for kids in this one\ncase if parents were not so unselfish.  A parent who set an example\nof loving their work might help their kids more than an expensive\nhouse.\n[3]It was not till I was in college that the idea of work finally broke\nfree from the idea of making a living.  Then the important question\nbecame not how to make money, but what to work on.  Ideally these\ncoincided, but some spectacular boundary cases (like Einstein in\nthe patent office) proved they weren't identical.The definition of work was now to make some original contribution\nto the world, and in the process not to starve.  But after the habit\nof so many years my idea of work still included a large component\nof pain.  Work still seemed to require discipline, because only\nhard problems yielded grand results, and hard problems couldn't\nliterally be fun.   Surely one had to force oneself to work on them.If you think something's supposed to hurt, you're less likely to\nnotice if you're doing it wrong.  That about sums up my experience\nof graduate school.BoundsHow much are you supposed to like what you do?  Unless you\nknow that, you don't know when to stop searching. And if, like most\npeople, you underestimate it, you'll tend to stop searching too\nearly.  You'll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents,\nor the desire to make money, or prestige—or sheer inertia.Here's an upper bound: Do what you love doesn't mean, do what you\nwould like to do most this second.  Even Einstein probably\nhad moments when he wanted to have a cup of coffee, but told himself\nhe ought to finish what he was working on first.It used to perplex me when I read about people who liked what they\ndid so much that there was nothing they'd rather do.  There didn't\nseem to be any sort of work I liked that much.  If I had a\nchoice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b)\nbe teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about, was\nthere any sort of work I'd prefer?  Honestly, no.But the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment,\nfloat about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some delicious\nfood, than work on hard problems.  The rule about doing what you\nlove assumes a certain length of time.  It doesn't mean, do what\nwill make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest\nover some longer period, like a week or a month.Unproductive pleasures pall eventually.  After a while you get tired\nof lying on the beach.  If you want to stay happy, you have to do\nsomething.As a lower bound, you have to like your work more than any unproductive\npleasure.  You have to like what you do enough that the concept of\n\"spare time\" seems mistaken.  Which is not to say you have to spend\nall your time working.  You can only work so much before you get\ntired and start to screw up.  Then you want to do something else—even something mindless.  But you don't regard this time as the\nprize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to earn\nit.I put the lower bound there for practical reasons.  If your work\nis not your favorite thing to do, you'll have terrible problems\nwith procrastination.  You'll have to force yourself t\nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\no work,  and\nwhen you resort to that the results are distinctly inferior.To be happy I think you have to be doing something you not only\nenjoy, but admire.  You have to be able to say, at the end, wow,\nthat's pretty cool.  This doesn't mean you have to make something.\nIf you learn how to hang glide, or to speak a foreign language\nfluently, that will be enough to make you say, for a while at least,\nwow, that's pretty cool.  What there has to be is a test.So one thing that falls just short of the standard, I think, is\nreading books.  Except for some books in math and the hard sciences,\nthere's no test of how well you've read a book, and that's why\nmerely reading books doesn't quite feel like work.  You have to do\nsomething with what you've read to feel productive.I think the best test is one Gino Lee taught me: to try to do things\nthat would make your friends say wow.  But it probably wouldn't\nstart to work properly till about age 22, because most people haven't\nhad a big enough sample to pick friends from before\n\n\n\nOn this moonlit and misty night, the little penguin is looking up at the sky, entirely focused on counting ★.

They're already stuck with a seller's\nmarket, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the\nBubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end\nof the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the\nnorm\nin the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because\nit's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open\nsource, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware\ngeometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free\nif you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot\ncheaper.When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest\nexpenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,\nthe only software that then supported secure http connections.  We\npaid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of\nmemory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software\nfor free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first\nserver; and if you make something good you can generate ten times\nas much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got\nthrough the print media.And of course another big change for the average startup is that\nprogramming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has.  At most startups ten years\nago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in\nC++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python\nor Ruby.During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would\noutsource their development to India.  I think a better model for\nthe future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development\nto a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications\nare now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one\nguy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste\nany time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can\npay himself nothing.Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now\noften want to give startups more money than the startups want to\ntake.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one\nVC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a\nmillion, \"I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just\nhave to give some of it back.\" Meaning give some of the fund back\nto the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't\ngoing to be possible to invest it all.Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.\nSarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically\nincreases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition\nto the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a\nyear, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate\nofficers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: \"I would not\nwant to be CFO of a public company now.\"You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area\nwhere you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and\nthis remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO\nis both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If\nSarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  \ncompanies, that's proof enough that it's broken.Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For\nall practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which\nmeans VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3\nman startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100\nmillion to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's\njust what their business has evolved into.Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they\ncan buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startup\nThe little penguin counted 3 ★\ns\nthey want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't\nwant anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR\ndepartments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,\nand that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated\nsoftware and developers.Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.\n\"Bring us your startups early,\" said Google's speaker at the Startup School.  They're quite\nexplicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point\nwhere they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the\nfirst round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first\nyear.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology\ncompanies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have \nstill more of their lunch eaten by Google.Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the\npeople there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.\nOrdinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;\nit's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich\nwhen you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   \nfor your company to do.The Solution(s)Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.\nThey need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  \nanother that will seem an anathema.Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  \nloosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to\ndestroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead\nwhen it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now \nthat technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly\nwhat a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings\nare worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the\neconomy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think\nmost politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   \nfragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral\ndamage of laws meant to fix some other problem.Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very\nlittle noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll\nhear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,\nall that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in \ngrad school instead of starting a company.My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  \nout partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest\nin a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the \nmoney goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from\nthe founders as well.Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They\ndon't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes\npublic.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll\nhave less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock\nearly would generally be better for the company, because it would\ncause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the\nVCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend\nto be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would\nprefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,\nwhile the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter.Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies\nearly instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up\nfront.  That first million is just worth so much more than the\nsubsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,\nthey'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger\noutcome.So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least\nhalf million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   \nmoney.  So what if some of the money would go t\nThe little penguin counted 5 ★\no the  \nfounders instead of the company?Some VCs will say this is\nunthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work\ngrowing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC\ninvestments is dictated by the structure\nof VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  \ninvestments go to work destroying the company rather than growing\nit.The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell\nsome stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. \nThe angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.\nAnd for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness\nof a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a\nmotivator.If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially\ncash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you\nare now competing directly with Google.\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.May 2001\n\n(These are some notes I made\nfor a panel discussion on programming language design\nat MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone\nwould like programming in a language where all the variables were\nthe letter x with integer subscripts.2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best\nones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a\nlot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific\ngroup of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.\nSo you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most\nextreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty\nlow-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's\nwhy hackers like it.The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that\nthere are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be\nso.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately\nlarge percentage of the software.I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that\nthe very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is\nidentical to the question, how do you design a good programming\nlanguage?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting\nquestion.3. Give the Prog\nThe little penguin counted 9 ★\nrammer as Much Control as Possible.Many languages\n(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude\nof a governess: they try to prevent you from\ndoing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   \nopposite approach: give the programmer as much\ncontrol as you can.When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was\nthat it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages\nI had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   \nprogram, written in the language, and the two were very separate.\nBut in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those\nthat made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language\nif I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.4. Aim for Brevity.Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.\nBut if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they\nreally love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly\nof how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple\nlines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really\nlove is worth paying attention to.I think almost anything\nyou can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots\nof library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;\nthe syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things\nshould be short.And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should\nbe thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications\nand reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  \nyourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing\nthe things in the language that required so much explanation.5. Admit What Hacking Is.A lot of people wish that hacking was\nmathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think\nhacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is\nrelated to physics, in the sense that architects have to design\nbuildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects\nis to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.What hackers like to do is make great programs.\nAnd I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's\nan admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work \ndoesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual\ncurrency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as\nworthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a\nhorrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper\nabout.1. How to Organize Big Libraries?Libraries are becoming an\nincreasingly important component of programming languages.  They're\nalso getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer\nto find the library function that will do what you want than it\nwould take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing\nbut make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in \npoint.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize\nlibraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer\ncould guess what library call would do the right thing.2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?This is an open\nproblem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and\nstill don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural\nto me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of \nLisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   \nWhether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. \n\n3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?\n\nI think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written\nin the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning\nprograms that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web\nbrowser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some\nnew things.One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based \napps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a\nyear, like desktop software, server-ba\nThe little penguin counted 15 ★\nsed apps get released as a\nseries of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten\nreleases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest\nversion.You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?\nWell, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be\nchangeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least\nto know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based\nsoftware, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software\nyou can use something like continuation-passing style to get the\neffect of subroutines in the inherently \nstateless world of a Web\nsession.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,\nif it was not too expensive.4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?I'm not sure how\nreasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    \ndo, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would\nmake as much of a difference as having first class functions or\nrecursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible\ndream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always\nlooking.1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.Writing application\nprograms used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop\nsoftware there is a big bias toward writing the application in the\nsame language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,\nwriting software pretty much meant writing software in C.\nEventually a tradition evolved:\napplication programs must not be written in unusual languages.  \nAnd this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people\nlike managers and venture capitalists also learned it.Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based\nsoftware you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands\nthis yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).\nA few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear\nabout new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing\nabout Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows\napps.What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming\nlanguages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for\nour work.2. Speed Comes from Profilers.Language designers, or at least\nlanguage implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast\ncode.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.\nKnuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical\nbottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess\nwhere these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need\nbenchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show\nthem what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's\nwhere speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net \nwin if language implementors took half the time they would\nhave spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a\ngood profiler instead.3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages\nall evolved together with some application they were being used to\nwrite.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.\nLisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and\nMcCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation\nprograms even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.\nThat will tend to drive your language to have new features that   \nprogrammers need.  I personally am interested in writing\na language that will be good for writing server-based applications.[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the\nadditional suggestion that the application should not consist of\nwriting the compiler for your language, unless your language\nhappens to be intend\nThe little penguin counted 19 ★\ned for writing compilers.]4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for\nsome limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  \na lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I\nwould not be surprised if most programs started as throwaway\nprograms.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for\nwriting software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway\nprograms, because that is the larval stage of most software.5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.It's traditional to think of\nsyntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will\nsound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.\nI think that what you want in your language may be related\nto how you express it.I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that\noperator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix\nsyntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define\nis effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a\nnew type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function\nto add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,\nthere's a big difference in appearance between the use of an\noverloaded operator and a function call.1. New Programming Languages.Back in the 1970s\nit was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently\nit hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  \nlanguages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can\nuse any language you want, so if someone does design a language that\nactually seems better than others that are available, there will be\npeople who take a risk and use it.2. Time-Sharing.Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time\nhas come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.\nMy guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing\nwill move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  \ntime-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support\nfor it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard\nand Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  \nscheduling within Scheme 48.3. Efficiency.Recently it was starting to seem that computers\nwere finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear\nabout byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have\ncycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based\nsoftware.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that\nthe software runs on, and the number of users they can support per\nmachine will be the divisor of their capital cost.So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational\nbottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,\nbecause server-based applications do a lot of i/o.It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and\nMicrosoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte\ncodes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a\nconvenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because\nbyte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this\nwhole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.1. Clients.This is just a guess, but my guess is that\nthe winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.\nDesigning software that works on the assumption that everyone will \nhave your client is like designing a society on the assumption that\neveryone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but\nyou have to assume it will never happen.I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some\nkind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is\nthat they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a\nbrowser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  \npilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able\nto browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  \nAnd I don'\nThe little penguin counted 21 ★\nt have to know if I bet on\neverything just being on the server.  It's\njust so much more robust to have all the \nbrains on the server.2. Object-Oriented Programming.I realize this is a\ncontroversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming\nis such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds\nof applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   \nlike window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't\nsee why it ought to be the model for all programming.I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented\nprogramming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.\nSomething that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of\nintegers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of\nscaffolding and hustle and bustle.Another attraction of\nobject-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the\neffect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp\nprogrammers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can\njust use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,\ninstead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't\nbuild object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the\nanswer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design\nwhatever object systems they want as libraries.3. Design by Committee.Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  \nand not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone\nknows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  \nBut I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.\nWhen one person is in charge he can take risks\nthat a committee would never agree on.Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?\nMany people might suspect\nthat language design is something where you should stick fairly\nclose to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.\nIn everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.\nWhy should language design be any different?January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are t\nThe little penguin counted 26 ★\noday.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe\nThe little penguin counted 29 ★\n in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\nThe only fo\nThe little penguin counted 35 ★\nrm of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\na stack of punch cards and then stopping. \n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\nbut what m\nThe little penguin counted 38 ★\nade it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\nwas something you could make t\nThe little penguin counted 42 ★\nhat would last. Paintings didn't\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\nart in Florence that the Italian\nThe little penguin counted 46 ★\n students would otherwise have been\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\nvocabulary. \n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\nold. \n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\nsense. \n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\nfor granted, just as you can  after\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a so\nThe little penguin counted 49 ★\nrt of\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\nplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\nBetter organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pret\nThe little penguin counted 54 ★\nty rigorous. No doubt\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\nPainting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\nof dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\nbest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\ndefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A\nrent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\nUpper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\nNow I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\ndays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers\nof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't\nthat much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work\non whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called\nthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited\nhim in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It\nseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical\nuser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.\nI w\nThe little penguin counted 58 ★\nas right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\nwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art\ngalleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy\nones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate\nweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and\nset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up\ngalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.\nIt was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites\nfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that\nexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd\nbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called\nan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy\nof ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write\nsoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to be\nnormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.\nThat was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to\nwrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix\nworld. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new\nsite generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate\nwas away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his\nroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a\nmattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress\nI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran\nthe software on the server, and let users control it by clicking\non links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve\nthem from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at\nthe time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,\nwe decided to try making a version of our store builder that you\ncould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August\n12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you\ncould build a whole store through the browser, without any client\nsoftware or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a\nwhole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't\nneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there\nhad been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to\nbe at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.\nNow you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our\nsoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding\nfrom Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the\ninitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%\nof the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y\nCombinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because\nwe'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand\ndollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by\nwhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside\nthe proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?\nNo, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,\nI needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious\nabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to\nbuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating\npa\nThe little penguin counted 61 ★\nges, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be\ngenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,\nthe links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the\nserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online\nstore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking\nlegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts\nand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his\nbedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because\nit's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but\nin 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a\nmonth,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in\nretrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years\nlater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,\nand I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.\nHe recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because\nat that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything\nin his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with\nhim. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a\nfrighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two\nmost independent-minded people \nI know, and in completely different\nways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a\ncolonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's\nit would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just\nas well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were\nlate, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of\ntalk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually\nwanted online stores.\n[8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which\npeople used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,\nwhich Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and\nstatistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one\nof the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight\nand didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's\nand Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do\nwas work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the\neasiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of\nit stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were\ninstead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second\nhalf of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not\nthe Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It\nwas lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make\nViaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a\nmonth for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low\nprice was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of\ncompetitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we\nset the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.\n$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,\nwe did what's now called \"doing things that \ndon't scale,\" although\nat the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're\ndriven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common\nof which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly\nhumiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that\npeople could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get\nusers.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For\nexample, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt\n(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better\nto have a closeup of the collar than a pict\nThe little penguin counted 66 ★\nure of the whole shirt.\nThe reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to\nrescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were\nso beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.\nBuilding stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it\nfelt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled\nby \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in\ncharge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,\nin much the same way I was converted to \nfatherhood once I had kids.\nWhatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have\nso many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in\nthe meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn't get at the time is that \ngrowth rate is the\nultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about\n70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I\nmistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number\nof users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that\nthat's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough,\nyou might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate\ntakes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was\nadvising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed\nout, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't\nhire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then\nyou'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted\nme to, and partly because that's what startups did during the\nInternet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would\nhave seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about\nwhen Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we\nwere at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.\nAnd since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the\nresult was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb\nstock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable\nand growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had\nno idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of\nthe near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor\nhad I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we\nstarted. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to\nriches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow\n1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were\nby far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must\nhave been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at\nthe time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running\nViaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue\nmy usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue\ncombined with Yahoo's prematurely aged\nculture and grim cube farm\nin Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it\nfelt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the\ntime I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth\nanything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next\nyear. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the\nsummer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything\nthat I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been\nentirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had\ndone this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now\nI was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation\nwith me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures\nI wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an\ninterest in me. Now I realize i\nThe little penguin counted 69 ★\nt was because he thought I was lying.\nMy options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I\nwas leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to\ngo and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people\nwith me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was\nground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving\nthen to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,\nand yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.\nThere was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich.\nNow when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their\ncompanies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's\nwhat I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing\nfor a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or\nambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people\nin California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in\nthe Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from\nanywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation\nI went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent\ncontrol you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed\nup like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and\nthere were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't\nknow any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was\nrich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns,\nexcept now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was\ntired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless\nit was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked\npast charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It\nwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented\nwith a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the\nold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and\nthen use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted\nfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually\nchoose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and\nvarious real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by\noccasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there\nwasn't one. Huh.Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear\nfrom our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why\nnot build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit\ncode on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting\napplications for them?\n[9]\nYou could run all sorts of services\non the servers that these applications could use just by making an\nAPI call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images,\ntaking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything\nelse. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly\nwant to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would\nhave to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and\nstart it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but\nthere I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and\nthough he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into\nworking on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.\nSo while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly\nrefused to work on it.Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had\nworked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and\nwe got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty\ncompanies and several open source projects worth of software. The\nlanguage for defining applications would of course be a dialect of\nLisp. But I wasn't so naive as t\nThe little penguin counted 74 ★\no assume I could spring an overt\nLisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan\ndid.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an\n\"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long\nbefore it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current\nfor long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going\nto be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network\ninfrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two\nservices (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the\nsummer I realized I really didn't want to run a company  especially\nnot a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I'd\nonly started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't\nneed money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be\nrealized as a company, then screw the vision. I'd build a subset\nthat could be done as an open source project.Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not\nwasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often\nencounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and\nit was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and\neven trying to write some of it.The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp,\nwhose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp\nhackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the\ndistinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and\npartly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of\nLisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So\nat the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new\ndialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a\ntalk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp\nat Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,\non paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but\nhad never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.\nWhat on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone\nhad posted it on Slashdot.\n[10]Wow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put\nit on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but\nit was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel\nto readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only\nway to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published\nas a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish\nanything.This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people\nhad realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building\nthe infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer\nas well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it\ntook me several years to understand the implications. It meant there\nwould be a whole new generation of \nessays.\n[11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been\nvanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers\nwho went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed\nto publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.\nThere were so many essays that had never been written, because there\nhad been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going\nto write them.\n[12]I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there\nwas a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was\nwhen I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that\nwhatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a \nmarginal medium at first.\nSocially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their\nGeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions\npublished in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to\nfind that encouraging in\nThe little penguin counted 77 ★\nstead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how\nwell it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't\nprestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form\nof painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started\nthem. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what\nI'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish\non my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in\nsomething like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when\nyou find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current\nlack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to\nbe discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.\nImpure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is\ngoing to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.\nSo while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee\nyou're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the\nmost common type of wrong one.Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds\nof different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a\nbook, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I\nalso worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to\nhave dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which\ntaught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in\nCambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn\nstudio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\ndiners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one\nparty. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be\npeople they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\ncalled Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.\nThis bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,\nas she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised\nhow different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So\nshe decided to compile a book of \ninterviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her\nstaff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed\nfor a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make\nup their minds, and during this time I started telling her about\nall the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They\nshould make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a\nhandful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical\nfounders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as\nCEO, and so on.One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks.\nThe prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people\nand tell them something that won't waste their time is a great\nspur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the\nundergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would\ntell them how to start a startup. Maybe they'd be able to avoid the\nworst of the mistakes we'd made.So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the\nbest sources of seed funding were successful startup founders,\nbecause then they'd be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed\nthey were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect\nof having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known),\nI blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk. But afterward\nit occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about\nangel investing. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now\nit was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one ange\nThe little penguin counted 81 ★\nl investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects\nwe could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed\nlike there had to be something we could collaborate on.As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the\ncorner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged.\nScrew the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We'd\nstart our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd\nbeen talking about. I'd fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and\nwork for it, and we'd get Robert and Trevor as partners too.\n[13]Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to\nbe angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways\nto learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices,\nand some of the things we did turned out to be novel.There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn't figure\nthem all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm.\nIn those days, those two words didn't go together. There were VC\nfirms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was\nto make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments.\nAnd there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were\nindividuals who were usually focused on other things and made\ninvestments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough\nin the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects,\nbecause we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing\nJulian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us\nset up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software,\nbut actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all\nthat stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to\nmake seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had\ndone for us.YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we\nfunded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers,\nbut professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got\nall the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular\ninsight on our part. We didn't know how VC firms were organized.\nIt never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we\nwouldn't have known where to start.\n[14]The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a\nbunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three\nmonths focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we\ndiscovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due\nto our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as\ninvestors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch\nof startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech\ncompanies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where\nthey'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being\nin a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense\nbe fake founders. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out\nof it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and\nthey for their part would probably have a more interesting summer\nthan they would working at Microsoft.We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters.\nWe'd all have dinner there once a week  on tuesdays, since I was\nalready cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays  and after\ndinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a\nmatter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders\nProgram, and I posted an \nannouncement \non my site, inviting undergrads\nto apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way\nto get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be\nthe perfect source.\n[15]\nWe got 225 applications for the Summer\nFounders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them\nwere from people who'd \nThe little penguin counted 86 ★\nalready graduated, or were about to that\nspring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious\nthan we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and\nfrom those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That\nfirst batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went\non to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the\nRSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access,\nand Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.\nI don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.\nYou had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the\nSummer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place\nlike Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did\nwith Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students\ngot for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the\ntypical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to\nbe fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had\ntaken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought\nthe founders free air conditioners.\n[16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale\nstartup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient\nfor us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups\nat once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too.\nIt solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the\nisolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who\nunderstood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they\nwere solving them.As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The\nalumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another,\nand especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being\nin. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's\ncustomers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YC\ngrows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups\nget their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their\nbatchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going\nto do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew,\nand I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more\nthan a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was\nstill able to work on other things.In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version\nof Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into\nScheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was\noriginally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and\nwas called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of\nreading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders\nwe wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed\nthe name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's\nintellectual curiosity.HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest\nsource of stress for me. If all I'd had to do was select and help\nfounders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN\nwas a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work\nshould at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas\nI was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not\nfrom the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an\nill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during\nYC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40%\nchance it had do with everything else combined.\n[17]As well as HN, I wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc. But\nwhile I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped\nworking on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly\nbecause it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language\nnow that we had all this infrastructure depending on\nThe little penguin counted 89 ★\n it. So now my\nthree projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on\nYC.YC was different from other kinds of work I've done. Instead of\ndeciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every\n6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems,\nwhatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work,\nbecause their problems were quite varied, and the good founders\nwere very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could\nabout startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have\npicked a better way to do it.There were parts of the job I didn't like. Disputes between cofounders,\nfiguring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who\nmaltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the\nparts I didn't like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once\nsaid about companies: \"No one works harder than the boss.\" He meant\nit both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second\npart that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked\nset the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better\nwork very hard.One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews,\nRobert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited\nadvice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at\nViaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested\nthat it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital.\nThat was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I\nremember his exact words very clearly. \"You know,\" he said, \"you\nshould make sure Y Combinator isn't the last cool thing you do.\"At the time I didn't understand what he meant, but gradually it\ndawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange\nadvice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer\nthan Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me\nthinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be\nthe last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my\nattention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of\neating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave\neventually. And it wasn't, so I would.In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned\nout to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed\nher balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really\nwanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I\nwere determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to\nvisit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those\nflights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to\nsomeone else.I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so\nwe decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and\nTrevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard.\nUp till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we\nfour had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to\ndo that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said\nyes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and\nJessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he\nsaid no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors.\nBut I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided\nhe'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest\nof 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could\nlearn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose\ncancer had returned.She died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was\nstill hard when it did.I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups\nthrough Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still\ntalk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested\nin, but that only takes a few hours a week.)What should I do \nThe little penguin counted 94 ★\nnext? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about\nthat. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided\nI'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused\non it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting.\nI was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was\nat least completely engaging.\n[18]I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to\nwork so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had\nbeen. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the\nmiddle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd\nalways been curious to see how the painting I was working on would\nturn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So\nI stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted\nsince. So far anyway.I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum\ngame. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project\nthat's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's\ngetting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was\nsome opportunity cost to screwing around.I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over\nthe next few months. I even wrote a couple that \nweren't about\nstartups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language\ndefined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally\nintended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was\nmeant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the\nTuring machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language\nin itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need?\nThe Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered,\nis an answer to that question.\n[19]McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program\ncomputers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell\ntranslated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language,\nand from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language\nin the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation\ngave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.\nIt was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand\nwhy at the time.McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions.\nIt was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language.\nSo these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined\nusing McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have\nbeen feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by\nhand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting\nclose to the limit of interpreters you could test that way  indeed,\nthere was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more\ncomplicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers\nthen weren't powerful enough.Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's\naxiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language.\nAnd as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a\ndiscoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle,\nend up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to\ndo than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle,\nwhy not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years,\nfrom March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I\nhad a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep\nat it for so long.I wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, \nin itself in Arc. That may sound\nlike a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery\nI had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious\ncollection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an\ninterpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast,\nbut fast enough to test.I had to ban myself from writing essays during most\nThe little penguin counted 97 ★\n of this time,\nor I'd never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing\nessays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely\nunderstand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as\nbecause the problem is so convoluted. When you're working on an\ninterpreter written in itself, it's hard to keep track of what's\nhappening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted\nby the time you get them.So I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people\nabout Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have\nseemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder\nthan I'd ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for\nhours with some gruesome bug I'd check Twitter or HN and see someone\nasking \"Does Paul Graham still code?\"Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively\nthat at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head\nand could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the\ncoast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some\nproblem involving continuations while I watched them play in the\ntide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that\nbecause I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news\nis that I had more moments like this over the next few years.In the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to\nsee what it was like living in another country, and since I was a\nBritish citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only\nmeant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still\nlive there. So most of Bel was written in England.In the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's\noriginal Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although\nlike McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics\nI'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also\nstarted to think about other things I could work on. How should I\nchoose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the\npast? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I\nwas surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If\nthis surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would\nbe interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with\nsimilarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others\nto read, and this is the last sentence of it.\nNotes[1]\nMy experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers:\ntime-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from\nbatch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem\nall the more exciting.[2]\nItalian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be\npredicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps\nlike polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you\nstring together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs,\nyou can make a little Italian go a long way.[3]\nI lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia\nwent straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across\nthe bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery,\nand then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at\nstreet level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter\nevenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with\ntourists.[4]\nYou can of course paint people like still lives if you want\nto, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex\nof still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce\npained expressions in the sitters.[5]\nInterleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and\nbuilt impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law.\nIn the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e.\nIntel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and\nsoftware companies like a bulldozer.[6]\nThe signature style seekers at RISD \nThe little penguin counted 102 ★\nweren't specifically\nmercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled.\nAnything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as\ncool will soon become equally expensive.[7]\nTechnically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but\nrent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would\nknow or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less\nthan half market price.[8]\nMost software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when\nthe software is an online store builder and you're hosting the\nstores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully\nobvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch\nprivately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and\nmaking sure they had decent-looking stores.[9]\nWe'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their\nown page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp\nexpressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the\ncode ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers\nvisited them.[10]\nThis was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience,\nand so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found\nthey were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was\nbetter than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete?\nPeople who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me\nhow sorry they feel for me, but I'm not exaggerating when I reply\nthat it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It\ncomes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they\ndon't already know, and some \npeople dislike being told such things.[11]\nPeople put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of\ncourse, but putting something online is not the same as publishing\nit online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as\nthe (or at least a) primary version.[12]\nThere is a general lesson here that our experience with Y\nCombinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long\nafter the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary\nVC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays,\nbeen based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more\nexpensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap\nand common, but the VCs' customs still reflected the old world,\njust as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints\nof the print era.Which in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e.\nless influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected\nby rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).Here's an interesting point, though: you can't always predict which\nfields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and\nventure capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay\nwriting would be?[13]\nY Combinator was not the original name. At first we were\ncalled Cambridge Seed. But we didn't want a regional name, in case\nsomeone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after\none of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.I picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and\npartly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors\nlike maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying\nto appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside\njoke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made\nthe YC logo a white Y on an orange square.[14]\nYC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009,\nbecause it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it\npersonally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go\nback to being self-funded.[15]\nI've never liked the term \"deal flow,\" because it implies\nthat the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This\nis not only false, but it's the purpose of YC to falsify it, by\ncausing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.[16]\nShe reports t\nThe little penguin counted 107 ★\nhat they were all different shapes and sizes,\nbecause there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get\nwhatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could\ncarry now.[17]\nAnother problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs\nwhen you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum,\nyou're assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every\nconversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post\nhighly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually\nthese two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination\nis disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations,\nbecause the assumption that you're present in the conversation means\nthat not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation\nreads as a tacit admission that it's correct. But that in turn\nencourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses\nthat now is their chance.[18]\nThe worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica\nanymore. We'd been working on YC almost the whole time we'd known\neach other, and we'd neither tried nor wanted to separate it from\nour personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted\ntree.[19]\nOne way to get more precise about the concept of invented vs\ndiscovered is to talk about space aliens. Any sufficiently advanced\nalien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean\ntheorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty, that\nthey would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy's 1960 paper.But if so there's no reason to suppose that this is the limit of\nthe language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need\nnumbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at\nleast one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness\nis preserved.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel\nGackle, Ralph Hazell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj\nTaggar for reading drafts of this.December 2014If the world were static, we could have monotonically increasing\nconfidence in our beliefs.  The more (and more varied) experience\na belief survived, the less likely it would be false.  Most people\nimplicitly believe something like this about their opinions.  And\nthey're justified in doing so with opinions about things that don't\nchange much, like human nature.  But you can't trust your opinions\nin the same way about things that change, which could include\npractically everything else.When experts are wrong, it's often because they're experts on an\nearlier version of the world.Is it possible to avoid that?  Can you protect yourself against\nobsolete beliefs?  To some extent, yes. I spent almost a decade\ninvesting in early stage startups, and curiously enough protecting\nyourself against obsolete beliefs is exactly what you have to do\nto succeed as a startup investor.  Most really good startup ideas\nlook like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad specifically\nbecause some change in the world just switched them from bad to\ngood.  I spent a lot of time learning to recognize such ideas, and\nthe techniques I used may be applicable to ideas in general.The first step is to have an explicit belief in change.  People who\nfall victim to a monotonically increasing confidence in their\nopinions are implicitly concluding the world is static.  If you\nconsciously remind yourself it isn't, you start to look for change.Where should one look for it?  Beyond the moderately useful\ngeneralization that human nature doesn't change much, the unfortunate\nfact is that change is hard to predict.  This is largely a tautology\nbut worth remembering all the same: change that matters usually\ncomes from an unforeseen quarter.So I don't even try to predict it.  When I get asked in interviews\nto predict the future, I always have to struggle to come up with\nsomething plausible-sounding on the fly, like a student who hasn't\nprepared for an exam.\n[1]\nBut it's not out of l\nThe little penguin counted 109 ★\naziness that I haven't\nprepared.  It seems to me that beliefs about the future are so\nrarely correct that they usually aren't worth the extra rigidity\nthey impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively\nopen-minded.  Instead of trying to point yourself in the right\ndirection, admit you have no idea what the right direction is, and\ntry instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change.It's ok to have working hypotheses, even though they may constrain\nyou a bit, because they also motivate you.  It's exciting to chase\nthings and exciting to try to guess answers.  But you have to be\ndisciplined about not letting your hypotheses harden into anything\nmore.\n[2]I believe this passive m.o. works not just for evaluating new ideas\nbut also for having them.  The way to come up with new ideas is not\nto try explicitly to, but to try to solve problems and simply not\ndiscount weird hunches you have in the process.The winds of change originate in the unconscious minds of domain\nexperts.  If you're sufficiently expert in a field, any weird idea\nor apparently irrelevant question that occurs to you is ipso facto\nworth exploring. \n[3]\n Within Y Combinator, when an idea is described\nas crazy, it's a compliment—in fact, on average probably a\nhigher compliment than when an idea is described as good.Startup investors have extraordinary incentives for correcting\nobsolete beliefs.  If they can realize before other investors that\nsome apparently unpromising startup isn't, they can make a huge\namount of money.  But the incentives are more than just financial.\nInvestors' opinions are explicitly tested: startups come to them\nand they have to say yes or no, and then, fairly quickly, they learn\nwhether they guessed right.  The investors who say no to a Google\n(and there were several) will remember it for the rest of their\nlives.Anyone who must in some sense bet on ideas rather than merely\ncommenting on them has similar incentives.  Which means anyone who\nwants such incentives can have them, by turning their comments into\nbets: if you write about a topic in some fairly durable and public\nform, you'll find you worry much more about getting things right\nthan most people would in a casual conversation.\n[4]Another trick I've found to protect myself against obsolete beliefs\nis to focus initially on people rather than ideas. Though the nature\nof future discoveries is hard to predict, I've found I can predict\nquite well what sort of people will make them.  Good new ideas come\nfrom earnest, energetic, independent-minded people.Betting on people over ideas saved me countless times as an investor.\nWe thought Airbnb was a bad idea, for example. But we could tell\nthe founders were earnest, energetic, and independent-minded.\n(Indeed, almost pathologically so.)  So we suspended disbelief and\nfunded them.This too seems a technique that should be generally applicable.\nSurround yourself with the sort of people new ideas come from.  If\nyou want to notice quickly when your beliefs become obsolete, you\ncan't do better than to be friends with the people whose discoveries\nwill make them so.It's hard enough already not to become the prisoner of your own\nexpertise, but it will only get harder, because change is accelerating.\nThat's not a recent trend; change has been accelerating since the\npaleolithic era.  Ideas beget ideas.  I don't expect that to change.\nBut I could be wrong.\nNotes[1]\nMy usual trick is to talk about aspects of the present that\nmost people haven't noticed yet.[2]\nEspecially if they become well enough known that people start\nto identify them with you.  You have to be extra skeptical about\nthings you want to believe, and once a hypothesis starts to be\nidentified with you, it will almost certainly start to be in that\ncategory.[3]\nIn practice \"sufficiently expert\" doesn't require one to be\nrecognized as an expert—which is a trailing indicator in any\ncase.  In many fields a year of focused work plus caring a lot woul\nThe little penguin counted 113 ★\nd\nbe enough.[4]\nThough they are public and persist indefinitely, comments on\ne.g. forums and places like Twitter seem empirically to work like\ncasual conversation.  The threshold may be whether what you write\nhas a title.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, and Robert Morris\nfor reading drafts of this.\n\nWant to start a startup?  Get funded by\nY Combinator.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 2006To do something well you have to like it.   That idea is not exactly\nnovel.  We've got it down to four words: \"Do what you love.\"  But\nit's not enough just to tell people that.  Doing what you love is\ncomplicated.The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids.  When I\nwas a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition.\nLife had two states: some of the time adults were making you do\nthings, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could\ndo what you wanted, and that was called playing.  Occasionally the\nthings adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing\nwasn't—for example, if you fell and hurt yourself.  But except\nfor these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as\nnot-fun.And it did not seem to be an accident. School, it was implied, was\ntedious because it was preparation for grownup work.The world then was divided into two groups, grownups and kids.\nGrownups, like some kind of cursed race, had to work.  Kids didn't,\nbut they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version of\nwork meant to prepare us for the real thing.  Much as we disliked\nschool, the grownups all agreed that grownup work was worse, and\nthat we had it easy.Teachers in particular all seemed to believe implicitly that work\nwas not fun.  Which is not surprising: work wasn't fun for most of\nthem.  Why did we have to memorize state capitals instead of playing\ndodgeball?  For the same reason they had to watch over a bunch of\nkids instead of lying on a beach.  You couldn't just do what you\nwanted.I'm not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want.\nThey may have to be made to work on certain things.  But if we make\nkids work on dull stuff, it might be wise to tell them that tediousness\nis not the defining quality of work, and indeed that the reason\nthey have to work on dull stuff now is so they can work on more\ninteresting stuff later.\n[1]Once, when I was about 9 or 10, my father told me I could be whatever\nI wanted when I grew up, so long as I enjoyed it.  I remember that\nprecisely because it seemed so anomalous.  It was like being told\nto use dry water.  Whatever I thought he meant, I didn't think he\nmeant work could literally be fun—fun like playing.  It\ntook me years to grasp that.JobsBy high school, the prospect of an actual job was on the horizon.\nAdults would sometimes come to speak to us about their work, or we\nwould go to see them at work.  It was always understood that they\nenjoyed what they did.  In retrospect I think one may have: the\nprivate jet pilot.  But I don't think the bank manager really did.The main reason they all acted as if they enjoyed their work was\npresumably the upper-middle class convention that you're supposed\nto.  It would not merely be bad for your career to say that you\ndespised your job, but a social faux-pas.Why is it conventional to pretend to like what you do?  The first\nsentence of this essay explains that.  If you have to like something\nto do it well, then the most successful people will all like what\nthey do.  That's where the upper-middle class tradition comes from.\nJust as houses all over America are full of \nchairs\nthat are, without\nthe owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of chairs designed\n250 years ago for French kings, conventional attitudes about work\nare, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of\nthe attitudes of people who've done great things.What a recipe for alienation.  By the time they reach an age to\nthink about what they'd like to do, most kids have been thoroughly\nmisled about the idea of loving \nThe little penguin counted 117 ★\none's work.  School has trained\nthem to regard work as an unpleasant duty.  Having a job is said\nto be even more onerous than schoolwork.  And yet all the adults\nclaim to like what they do.  You can't blame kids for thinking \"I\nam not like these people; I am not suited to this world.\"Actually they've been told three lies: the stuff they've been taught\nto regard as work in school is not real work; grownup work is not\n(necessarily) worse than schoolwork; and many of the adults around\nthem are lying when they say they like what they do.The most dangerous liars can be the kids' own parents.  If you take\na boring job to give your family a high standard of living, as so\nmany people do, you risk infecting your kids with the idea that\nwork is boring. \n[2]\nMaybe it would be better for kids in this one\ncase if parents were not so unselfish.  A parent who set an example\nof loving their work might help their kids more than an expensive\nhouse.\n[3]It was not till I was in college that the idea of work finally broke\nfree from the idea of making a living.  Then the important question\nbecame not how to make money, but what to work on.  Ideally these\ncoincided, but some spectacular boundary cases (like Einstein in\nthe patent office) proved they weren't identical.The definition of work was now to make some original contribution\nto the world, and in the process not to starve.  But after the habit\nof so many years my idea of work still included a large component\nof pain.  Work still seemed to require discipline, because only\nhard problems yielded grand results, and hard problems couldn't\nliterally be fun.   Surely one had to force oneself to work on them.If you think something's supposed to hurt, you're less likely to\nnotice if you're doing it wrong.  That about sums up my experience\nof graduate school.BoundsHow much are you supposed to like what you do?  Unless you\nknow that, you don't know when to stop searching. And if, like most\npeople, you underestimate it, you'll tend to stop searching too\nearly.  You'll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents,\nor the desire to make money, or prestige—or sheer inertia.Here's an upper bound: Do what you love doesn't mean, do what you\nwould like to do most this second.  Even Einstein probably\nhad moments when he wanted to have a cup of coffee, but told himself\nhe ought to finish what he was working on first.It used to perplex me when I read about people who liked what they\ndid so much that there was nothing they'd rather do.  There didn't\nseem to be any sort of work I liked that much.  If I had a\nchoice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b)\nbe teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about, was\nthere any sort of work I'd prefer?  Honestly, no.But the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment,\nfloat about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some delicious\nfood, than work on hard problems.  The rule about doing what you\nlove assumes a certain length of time.  It doesn't mean, do what\nwill make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest\nover some longer period, like a week or a month.Unproductive pleasures pall eventually.  After a while you get tired\nof lying on the beach.  If you want to stay happy, you have to do\nsomething.As a lower bound, you have to like your work more than any unproductive\npleasure.  You have to like what you do enough that the concept of\n\"spare time\" seems mistaken.  Which is not to say you have to spend\nall your time working.  You can only work so much before you get\ntired and start to screw up.  Then you want to do something else—even something mindless.  But you don't regard this time as the\nprize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to earn\nit.I put the lower bound there for practical reasons.  If your work\nis not your favorite thing to do, you'll have terrible problems\nwith procrastination.  You'll have to force yourself to work,  and\nwhen you resort to th\nThe little penguin counted 122 ★\nat the results are distinctly inferior.To be happy I think you have to be doing something you not only\nenjoy, but admire.  You have to be able to say, at the end, wow,\nthat's pretty cool.  This doesn't mean you have to make something.\nIf you learn how to hang glide, or to speak a foreign language\nfluently, that will be enough to make you say, for a while at least,\nwow, that's pretty cool.  What there has to be is a test.So one thing that falls just short of the standard, I think, is\nreading books.  Except for some books in math and the hard sciences,\nthere's no test of how well you've read a book, and that's why\nmerely reading books doesn't quite feel like work.  You have to do\nsomething with what you've read to feel productive.I think the best test is one Gino Lee taught me: to try to do things\nthat would make your friends say wow.  But it probably wouldn't\nstart to work properly till about age 22, because most people haven't\nhad a big enough sample to pick friends from before then.SirensWhat you should not do, I think, is worry about the opinion of\nanyone beyond your friends.  You shouldn't worry about prestige.\nPrestige is the opinion of the rest of the world.  When you can ask\nthe opinions of people whose judgement you respect, what does it\nadd to consider the opinions of people you don't even know? \n[4]This is easy advice to give.  It's hard to follow, especially when\nyou're young.  \n[5]\nPrestige is like a powerful magnet that warps\neven your beliefs about what you enjoy.  It causes you to work not\non what you like, but what you'd like to like.That's what leads people to try to write novels, for example.  They\nlike reading novels.  They notice that people who write them win\nNobel prizes.  What could be more wonderful, they think, than to\nbe a novelist?  But liking the idea of being a novelist is not\nenough; you have to like the actual work of novel-writing if you're\ngoing to be good at it; you have to like making up elaborate lies.Prestige is just fossilized inspiration.  If you do anything well\nenough, you'll make it prestigious.  Plenty of things we now\nconsider prestigious were anything but at first.  Jazz comes to\nmind—though almost any established art form would do.   So just\ndo what you like, and let prestige take care of itself.Prestige is especially dangerous to the ambitious.  If you want to\nmake ambitious people waste their time on errands, the way to do\nit is to bait the hook with prestige.  That's the recipe for getting\npeople to give talks, write forewords, serve on committees, be\ndepartment heads, and so on.  It might be a good rule simply to\navoid any prestigious task. If it didn't suck, they wouldn't have\nhad to make it prestigious.Similarly, if you admire two kinds of work equally, but one is more\nprestigious, you should probably choose the other.  Your opinions\nabout what's admirable are always going to be slightly influenced\nby prestige, so if the two seem equal to you, you probably have\nmore genuine admiration for the less prestigious one.The other big force leading people astray is money.  Money by itself\nis not that dangerous.  When something pays well but is regarded\nwith contempt, like telemarketing, or prostitution, or personal\ninjury litigation, ambitious people aren't tempted by it.  That\nkind of work ends up being done by people who are \"just trying to\nmake a living.\"  (Tip: avoid any field whose practitioners say\nthis.)  The danger is when money is combined with prestige, as in,\nsay, corporate law, or medicine.  A comparatively safe and prosperous\ncareer with some automatic baseline prestige is dangerously tempting\nto someone young, who hasn't thought much about what they really\nlike.The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do\nit even if they weren't paid for it—even if they had to work at\nanother job to make a living.  How many corporate lawyers would do\ntheir current work if they had to do it for free, in their spare\ntime, and take day \nThe little penguin counted 127 ★\njobs as waiters to support themselves?This test is especially helpful in deciding between different kinds\nof academic work, because fields vary greatly in this respect.  Most\ngood mathematicians would work on math even if there were no jobs\nas math professors, whereas in the departments at the other end of\nthe spectrum, the availability of teaching jobs is the driver:\npeople would rather be English professors than work in ad agencies,\nand publishing papers is the way you compete for such jobs.  Math\nwould happen without math departments, but it is the existence of\nEnglish majors, and therefore jobs teaching them, that calls into\nbeing all those thousands of dreary papers about gender and identity\nin the novels of Conrad.  No one does \nthat \nkind of thing for fun.The advice of parents will tend to err on the side of money.  It\nseems safe to say there are more undergrads who want to be novelists\nand whose parents want them to be doctors than who want to be doctors\nand whose parents want them to be novelists.
